## 📝 All Grading Results

### 1. Correct: False 

**Question:** Describe the stability of the knee at different flexion angles based on the text.

**Expected:** The knee is stable in extension and 90° of flexion but unstable at 30° to 45° of flexion

**Actual:** Based on the available data, the stability of the knee at different flexion angles is described as follows:

- The knee demonstrates stability within a functional flexion arc ranging from 10° to 110°.
- The knee maintains consistent sagittal geometry.
- It operates on a single flexion/extension axis.

This information suggests that the knee remains stable across various flexion angles within the specified range of 10° to 110°.

**Justification:** The actual answer provided additional information about the knee's stability within a functional flexion arc ranging from 10° to 110°, which was not mentioned in the expected answer. It did not specifically address the instability at 30° to 45° of flexion as expected.

### 2. Correct: True 

**Question:** What is the primary concept behind the design of the Triathlon Universal Baseplate?

**Expected:** compatibility with various inserts and the ability to use a stem extension

**Actual:** The primary concept behind the design of the Triathlon Universal Baseplate is to provide compatibility with a range of insert options, including the CR (cruciate retaining), CS (condylar stabilizing), PS (posterior stabilized), and TS (Total Stabilizer) inserts. Additionally, the Universal Baseplate allows for the use of a stem extension, which has been shown in a finite element analysis to reduce cement-implant interface compressive and shear stress compared to a baseplate without a stem. This design flexibility and stress reduction are key aspects of the Triathlon Universal Baseplate's design concept.

**Justification:** The answer provided contains the primary concept behind the design of the Triathlon Universal Baseplate, including compatibility with various inserts and the ability to use a stem extension.

### 3. Correct: False 

**Question:** What is the description of the catalog number 5536-B-X00?

**Expected:** Triathlon Tritanium Tibial Baseplate – See Catalog

**Actual:** Based on the available data and the search for catalog number 5536-B-X00 in the "Size 3-6 Femoral & Tibial Preparation Kit Catalog" table, there are no matching rows found for this specific catalog number. Unfortunately, the description for catalog number 5536-B-X00 is not available in the provided document data.

**Justification:** The answer provided does not match the expected answer. The description for catalog number 5536-B-X00 was not found in the document data.

### 4. Correct: False 

**Question:** What is the product description for catalog number 5575-X-000?

**Expected:** Modular Femoral Distal Fixation Peg (2 per pack)

**Actual:** I'm sorry, but based on the available data, there doesn't seem to be any product description available for catalog number 5575-X-000 in the Conventional Polyethylene Patellas table. If you have any additional information or specific details related to this catalog number in the user notes, please provide them so I can assist you further.

**Justification:** The actual answer provided does not match the expected answer. It does not contain the product description 'Modular Femoral Distal Fixation Peg (2 per pack)' as requested.

**RAG Pipeline Analysis:**
- Expected source: ❌ 
- Content retrieved: ✅
- Tools used: get_row_data, get_table_data
- Iterations: 5
- Discovery issue: Expected page 'Asymmetric Patella and Modular Femoral Distal Fixation Peg Specifications' (ID: page_61) not found in discovery results
