### 2. Correct: True 

**Question:** What is the main purpose of the Triathlon PS Femoral Box Trial/Protector during the preparation process?

**Expected:** to protect the prepared femoral box

**Actual:** The main purpose of the Triathlon PS Femoral Box Trial/Protector during the preparation process is to protect the prepared femoral box before trialing with a femoral component. It is placed into the prepared box by hand to ensure the box trial is fully seated on the distal and posterior resections. The protector features a slot for a retractor to be placed for levering against the distal femur during tibial subluxation. It should be removed before assembling and implanting the Triathlon PS femoral component.

**Justification:** The answer provides a detailed explanation of the main purpose of the Triathlon PS Femoral Box Trial/Protector during the preparation process, including its function and when it should be removed.
