## üìù All Grading Results

### 1. Correct: True 

**Question:** In what way does FlexRod cater to individual patient anatomy?

**Expected:** FlexRod is designed to aid component placement matched to individual patient anatomy.

**Actual:** FlexRod caters to individual patient anatomy by allowing for adjustments in the height of the Tibial Resection Guide, Tibial Stylus, and Tibial Adjustment Housing. This adjustment can be made using the bronze wheel on the Tibial Adjustment Housing for both coarse and fine adjustments. Additionally, the Tibial Resection Guide can be pinned in place after adjustment to ensure precise resection of the proximal tibia based on the patient's specific anatomy.

**Justification:** The answer provides detailed information on how FlexRod caters to individual patient anatomy by allowing for adjustments in component placement based on the patient's specific anatomy.

### 2. Correct: True 

**Question:** What type of knee arthroplasty is being discussed in the context of single radius and multi-radius designs?

**Expected:** Total Knee Arthroplasty

**Actual:** Based on the available data, the type of knee arthroplasty being discussed in the context of single radius and multi-radius designs is the Triathlon knee arthroplasty. The Triathlon Tritanium Surgical Protocol table indicates that the Tibial Components of the Triathlon knee system are compatible with Triathlon tibial inserts in various designs, including cruciate retaining (CR), posterior stabilized (PS), and condylar stabilizing (CS) designs.

Therefore, the knee arthroplasty discussed in the context of single radius and multi-radius designs is the Triathlon knee arthroplasty with its compatible tibial components designed for different knee designs.

**Justification:** The answer provides the correct information about the type of knee arthroplasty being discussed in the context of single radius and multi-radius designs, which is the Triathlon knee arthroplasty.

### 3. Correct: True 

**Question:** What is the purpose of the Femoral Trial Assessment in Step 5?

**Expected:** The remaining portion of the technique is for both Posterior Stabilized or Cruciate Retaining.

**Actual:** The purpose of the Femoral Trial Assessment in Step 5 is to assess the fit of the Posterior Stabilized (PS) or Cruciate Retaining (CR) Femoral Trial after impacting it onto the prepared distal femur. It is essential to ensure that the trial is aligned with the distal plane and that all osteophytes beyond the end of the posterior condyles are removed during the assessment. This step helps in determining the suitability and proper fit of the femoral trial before proceeding further with the procedure.

**Justification:** The answer provides the correct information about the purpose of the Femoral Trial Assessment in Step 5, including assessing the fit of the Posterior Stabilized (PS) or Cruciate Retaining (CR) Femoral Trial and ensuring proper alignment.

### 4. Correct: False 

**Question:** What is the title of the catalog mentioned in the text content?

**Expected:** Size 3-6 Femoral & Tibial Preparation Kit Catalog

**Actual:** The title of the catalog mentioned in the text content is "MIS PS Box Cutting Guide."

**Justification:** The answer provided does not match the expected answer. The title mentioned in the text content is 'MIS PS Box Cutting Guide,' not 'Size 3-6 Femoral & Tibial Preparation Kit Catalog.'
