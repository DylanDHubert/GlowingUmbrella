### 2. Correct: True 

**Question:** What is the function of the Patella Inserter during the implantation process?

**Expected:** Position the Patella Inserter over the Capture and bring the two arms together until the native patella rests against the lower patella plate.

**Actual:** The function of the Patella Inserter during the implantation process is to facilitate the proper seating of the patella implant onto the native patella. Specifically, the Patella Inserter is used to ensure that the metal backing portion of the patella implant is fully seated onto the resected surface of the native patella. This process involves turning the T-handle of the Patella Inserter until the metal backing portion is fully seated.

Additionally, the Patella Inserter helps in positioning the patella implant and Patella Capture correctly, aligning the pegs of the Patellar Component to the fixation peg holes prepared earlier, and pressing the patellar pegs into the native patella.

It's important to follow the instructions provided for the proper use of the Patella Inserter during the implantation process to ensure the successful placement of the patella implant.

**Justification:** The actual answer provides a detailed explanation of the function of the Patella Inserter during the implantation process, including how it facilitates the seating of the patella implant onto the native patella. It covers all the key points mentioned in the expected answer.
