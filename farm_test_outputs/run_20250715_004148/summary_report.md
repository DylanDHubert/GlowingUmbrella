## üìù All Grading Results

### 1. Correct: True 

**Question:** What are the technical specifications related to the post/cam engagement of the Triathlon PS femur?

**Expected:** designed to engage the post of the tibial insert at approximately 45¬∞

**Actual:** Based on the available data, the Triathlon PS femur is designed to engage the post of the tibial insert at approximately 45¬∞, where natural PCL loading occurs. This engagement angle is a critical technical specification related to the post/cam engagement of the Triathlon PS femur. The document does not provide further detailed technical specifications specifically related to the post/cam engagement beyond the engagement angle mentioned.

If you need more detailed technical specifications related to the post/cam engagement of the Triathlon PS femur, it would be best to consult the official product documentation or contact the manufacturer directly for precise measurements or additional specifications not mentioned in the available data.

**Justification:** The answer provides the correct technical specification related to the post/cam engagement of the Triathlon PS femur, mentioning the engagement angle of approximately 45¬∞ where natural PCL loading occurs.

### 2. Correct: False 

**Question:** What is the weight percentage of Nitrogen in the Titanium alloy used for Cementless stems?

**Expected:** 0.05

**Actual:** The weight percentage of Nitrogen in the Titanium alloy used for Cementless stems is not directly provided in the available data. However, the weight percentage of Nitrogen is specified in the composition of the Vitallium Cobalt-Chrome Alloy (ASTM F75), not in the Titanium alloy information.

If you specifically need information on the weight percentage of Nitrogen in the Titanium alloy used for Cementless stems, this data is currently missing in the document.

**Justification:** The answer provided does not contain the exact weight percentage of Nitrogen in the Titanium alloy used for Cementless stems as expected.

**RAG Pipeline Analysis:**
- Expected source: ‚úÖ (rank 1)
- Content retrieved: ‚úÖ
- Tools used: get_page_content, get_table_data
- Iterations: 5

**Improvement:** The RAG system should be improved to extract and provide more specific data on the weight percentage of Nitrogen in the Titanium alloy used for Cementless stems.

### 3. Correct: False 

**Question:** What is the purpose of inserting a Headless Pin or the 1/8" Drill into the fixation hole?

**Expected:** to fix rotation

**Actual:** Based on the available data, the purpose of inserting a Headless Pin or the 1/8" Drill into the fixation hole is not explicitly mentioned in the tables provided. Since there is no specific information on the purpose of using these instruments in the available data, it might be related to orthopedic or surgical procedures where such instruments are commonly used for fixation or alignment purposes. For a more detailed explanation of their purpose, you may need to refer to additional resources or consult with a medical professional familiar with orthopedic instrumentation and procedures.

**Justification:** The answer does not directly address the purpose of inserting a Headless Pin or the 1/8" Drill into the fixation hole as 'to fix rotation', but rather provides a general explanation related to orthopedic or surgical procedures.

- Content retrieved: ‚úÖ
- Tools used: get_row_data, get_table_data
- Iterations: 5

**Improvement:** The answer could be improved by directly addressing the expected purpose of inserting a Headless Pin or the 1/8" Drill into the fixation hole as 'to fix rotation'.

### 4. Correct: True 

**Question:** Compare the part numbers of the Adjustment Block and the Universal Resection Guide.

**Expected:** Adjustment Block: 6541-1-600, Universal Resection Guide: 6541-1-721

**Actual:** The part numbers for the Adjustment Block and the Universal Resection Guide are as follows:

- Adjustment Block: Part Number 6541-1-600
- Universal Resection Guide: Part Number 6541-1-721

Therefore, the part numbers for the Adjustment Block and the Universal Resection Guide are 6541-1-600 and 6541-1-721, respectively.

**Justification:** The answer provided contains the exact expected part numbers for the Adjustment Block and the Universal Resection Guide.
