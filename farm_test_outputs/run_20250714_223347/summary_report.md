### 2. Correct: True 

**Question:** What is the purpose of the Femoral Alignment Guide as described in the text?

**Expected:** The Femoral Alignment Guide is designed for use on either the left or right knee and may be set to 5¬∞, 6¬∞ or 7¬∞ of valgus

**Actual:** The purpose of the Femoral Alignment Guide, as described in the text, is to assist in the alignment of the femur during knee arthroplasty. It is used in conjunction with the IM Rod to set the angle for the knee replacement surgery, allowing for precise alignment adjustments of 5¬∞, 6¬∞, or 7¬∞ of valgus. The guide helps in positioning the femoral component correctly in the knee joint.

**Justification:** The answer accurately describes the purpose of the Femoral Alignment Guide and its use in knee arthroplasty, including the specific angles of valgus it can be set to.

### 3. Correct: False 

**Question:** What was the outcome of the study involving patients who underwent Mako SmartRoboticsTM knee replacement?

**Expected:** patients with Triathlon implants achieved mid-flexion stability

**Actual:** Based on the available data, there is no specific information regarding the outcome of the study involving patients who underwent Mako SmartRobotics‚Ñ¢ knee replacement. The data provided focuses on survivorship results of different types of knee replacements, particularly the Triathlon Tritanium TKA and Triathlon Posterior Articulating (PA) Beaded Femur, at various follow-up periods.

To provide more details on the outcome of the study involving patients who underwent Mako SmartRobotics‚Ñ¢ knee replacement, additional information or a specific study related to this technology would be needed. If there are any user notes relevant to a study involving Mako SmartRobotics‚Ñ¢ knee replacement, please provide that information for further analysis.

**Justification:** The actual answer does not provide the specific outcome of the study involving patients who underwent Mako SmartRobotics‚Ñ¢ knee replacement as expected.

### 4. Correct: True 

**Question:** What is the purpose of the MIS PS Box Cutting Guide as described in the table?

**Expected:** MIS PS Box Cutting Guide

**Actual:** The purpose of the MIS PS Box Cutting Guide, as described in the table, is to facilitate the preparation of the distal femur for the PS box in femoral component surgeries. The guide is used to ensure proper alignment and positioning for subsequent procedures related to the PS box preparation, such as pinning the guide in place using Headless Pins and marking the location of the distal peg prep holes for further surgical steps. Additionally, the guide assists in achieving the desired position of the femoral component by aligning with the marked holes on the prepared femur.

**Justification:** The answer provided contains all the key information about the purpose of the MIS PS Box Cutting Guide as described in the table.
