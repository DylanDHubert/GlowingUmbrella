# Triathlon Tritanium Surgical Protocol
with Triathlon Cementless Beaded PA Femoral Component

## Description

Howmedica Osteonics Corp.'s total knee systems include the Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate which is designed to be used with the Triathlon Primary Knee system femoral components, tibial inserts, and patellar components for total reconstructive replacement of the knee joint. The characteristics specific to each device are detailed on the product label. The Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate is indicated for both cementless and cemented applications.

**Femoral Components:** The Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate is compatible with the Triathlon cruciate retaining (CR), and cruciate sacrificing (posteriorly stabilized ‚Äì PS) designs.

**Tibial Components:** The Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate is compatible with Triathlon tibial inserts in a cruciate retaining (CR), posterior stabilized (PS), and condylar stabilizing (CS) designs. Tibial inserts are available in a range of thicknesses and in various degrees of constraint.

**Note:** The Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate is packaged together with an Impactor Pad. The Impactor Pad is to be used during the tibial baseplate impaction step only and is to be discarded once impaction has completed. The Impactor Pad is not for implantation.

**Patellar Components:** Patellar resurfacing components are available in symmetric and asymmetric options in both all-plastic and metal-backed‚Å∫ designs. Use of a patellar component is optional. The Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate is compatible with all Triathlon patellar components.

*Additional Revision-ONLY Compatibility Note for Triathlon Tritanium Metal-Backed Patella‚Å∫:*
- The Triathlon Tritanium Metal-Backed Patella is indicated for use with the Total Stabilizer (TS) components including the metal bone augmentation components, the modular stem extensions and offsets. Only the Tritanium Metal-Backed Patella is compatible with the revision components.
- The Tritanium Tibial Baseplate is not compatible with the revision components.

‚Å∫The Triathlon Tritanium Metal-Backed Patella is not available for supply in Australia as it has not yet been included on the Australian Registry of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).

## Contraindications

- Any active or suspected latent infection in or about the knee joint.
- Distant foci of infection which may cause hematogenous spread to the implant site.
- Any mental or neuromuscular disorder which would create an unacceptable risk of prosthesis instability, prosthesis fixation failure, or complications in postoperative care.
- Bone stock compromised by disease, infection or prior implantation which cannot provide adequate support and/or fixation to the prosthesis.
- Skeletal immaturity.
- Severe instability of the knee joint secondary to the absence of collateral ligament integrity and function.

See package insert for warnings, precautions, adverse effects and other essential product information.

Before using Triathlon instrumentation, verify:
- Instruments have been properly disassembled prior to cleaning and sterilization;
- Instruments have been properly assembled post-sterilization;

# Triathlon Tritanium Surgical Protocol
with Triathlon Cementless Beaded PA Femoral Component

## Description

Howmedica Osteonics Corp.'s total knee systems include the Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate which is designed to be used with the Triathlon Primary Knee system femoral components, tibial inserts, and patellar components for total reconstructive replacement of the knee joint. The characteristics specific to each device are detailed on the product label. The Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate is indicated for both cementless and cemented applications.

**Femoral Components:** The Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate is compatible with the Triathlon cruciate retaining (CR), and cruciate sacrificing (posteriorly stabilized ‚Äì PS) designs.

**Tibial Components:** The Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate is compatible with Triathlon tibial inserts in a cruciate retaining (CR), posterior stabilized (PS), and condylar stabilizing (CS) designs. Tibial inserts are available in a range of thicknesses and in various degrees of constraint.

**Note:** The Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate is packaged together with an Impactor Pad. The Impactor Pad is to be used during the tibial baseplate impaction step only and is to be discarded once impaction has completed. The Impactor Pad is not for implantation.

**Patellar Components:** Patellar resurfacing components are available in symmetric and asymmetric options in both all-plastic and metal-backed‚Å∫ designs. Use of a patellar component is optional. The Triathlon Tritanium Baseplate is compatible with all Triathlon patellar components.

*Additional Revision-ONLY Compatibility Note for Triathlon Tritanium Metal-Backed Patella‚Å∫:*
- The Triathlon Tritanium Metal-Backed Patella is indicated for use with the Total Stabilizer (TS) components including the metal bone augmentation components, the modular stem extensions and offsets. Only the Tritanium Metal-Backed Patella is compatible with the revision components.
- The Tritanium Tibial Baseplate is not compatible with the revision components.
