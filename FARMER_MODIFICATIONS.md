# FARMER MODIFICATIONS

## FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Relevance Finder Table Title Matching Fix
**File:** `farm/src/farm/toolshed/exploration/relevance_finder.py`
**Issue:** The relevance finder was not checking table titles for relevance, only checking category, column names, sample values, and descriptions.
**Fix:** Added table title relevance checking with highest weight (0.9) in `_calculate_table_relevance()` method.
**Impact:** Now properly finds tables like "Oxford Knee Score (OKS) Over Time for Patients with Triathlon Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)" when searching for "Oxford Knee Score OKS".

### 2. RAG Diagnostic Analysis Fix
**File:** `test_farm_knee_system.py`
**Issue:** The `analyze_rag_pipeline()` method wasn't properly extracting debug information from the agentic loop structure.
**Fix:** Updated the method to correctly parse the debug data structure and extract tools used and iteration counts.
**Impact:** RAG diagnostics now show accurate information about tools used and iterations performed.

### 3. Success Rate Calculation Fix
**File:** `test_farm_knee_system.py`
**Issue:** The test was using simple string matching instead of LLM grading results for success calculation.
**Fix:** Updated to use LLM grader's binary correct/incorrect judgments for success rate calculation.
**Impact:** Test results now accurately reflect the LLM grader's assessment of answer quality.

### 4. OKS Test Script Fix
**File:** `run_oks_test.py`
**Issue:** The script was looking for `response['answer']` but when `debug=True` is passed, the response structure is different.
**Fix:** Updated to extract answer from `response['rag_response']['answer']` when debug mode is enabled.
**Impact:** OKS test now properly extracts answers from the debug response structure.
