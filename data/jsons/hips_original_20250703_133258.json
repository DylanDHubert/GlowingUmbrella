Stryker Robotic Arm Assisted System (RIO)\n\nThe MAKOplasty Total Hip Application uses the RIO Robotic Arm to consistently and reproducibly plan and execute primary Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). Using patient specific information gathered from a pre-operative CT scan, the surgeon has the flexibility to pre-operatively and intra-operatively adjust the plan to achieve proper biomechanical reconstruction of the hip for every patient with correct acetabular component orientation, center of rotation, combined anteversion, hip length, and combined offset.\n\nThe MAKOplasty Total Hip Application procedure provides acetabular cup inclination and version within ±5 degrees and the new acetabular center of rotation within ±2 mm of the pre-operative plan.\n\nThe RIO Robotic Arm System is comprised of the Robotic Arm, the Camera Stand, and the Guidance Module. The MAKOplasty Total Hip Application is the software loaded on the RIO System and all the implants, instruments and disposables required to complete the procedure. The different components of the RIO Robotic Arm System are labeled below.",

      "raw_content": "## B. MAKOplasty Total Hip Application Terminology\n\n### COR (Center of Rotation)\n\nCOR stands for Center of Rotation. It is displayed as a colored circle or sphere throughout the MAKOplasty Total Hip Application. The Green Sphere represents the planned acetabular cup center of rotation with the selected liner in place. The Magenta Sphere in 'Cup Plan Mode' represents the COR of the native acetabulum, which is defined by a sphere fit of ten points collected on the articular surface of the 3D acetabular model. The Magenta Sphere in 'Stem Plan Mode' represents the native femoral head center, which is defined in the Femoral CT Landmarks page. The Blue Sphere represents the selected stem head center for a given femoral stem and head length selection.\n\nThe three 'Center of Rotation Values' in the 'Cup Plan Mode' on the 'Implant Planning Page' represent the distance from the center of rotation of the native, diseased hip (Magenta Sphere) to the new planned acetabular center of rotation (Green Sphere). The 'Center of Rotation Values' on the 'Cup Reaming' page represent the distance the surgeon must ream to achieve this new, planned center of rotation.\n\n### End Effector\n\nThe End Effector is an instrument that attaches to the end of the Robotic Arm and holds the Reamer Handle and the Impaction Handle during the procedure. It is responsible for ensuring the RIO system knows the exact location of the reamer or cup during acetabular preparation. The end effector is located in the MAKOplasty Hip Array Kit.\n\n### Hip Length\n\nThe Hip Length measurement in the MAKOplasty Total Hip Application is very similar to Leg Length, except it is not just the superior/inferior shift in the length of the femur; the measurement also incorporates any superior or inferior shift in the center of the acetabulum due to reaming. The result is the total change in the length of the hip joint, not just the femur.\n\n### Combined Offset\n\nThe Combined Offset measurement in the MAKOplasty Total Hip Application is very similar to offset, except it is not just the medial/lateral shift in the distance from the midline of the femur to the femoral head center; the measurement also incorporates any medial or lateral shift in the center of the acetabulum due to reaming. The result is the total change in the offset of the hip joint, not just the femur.\n\n### Acetabular Cup Inclination\n\nThe inclination of the acetabular cup, also known as the abduction angle, is the angle of the Acetabular Reamer Handle or Impactor (as projected on the Coronal Plane) relative to the longitudinal axis of the body. The value displayed in the MAKOplasty Total Hip Application is not the true anatomic inclination; it is an adjusted value that takes into account the individual pelvic tilt for each patient (defined as radiographic inclination).\n\n### Acetabular Cup Version\n\nThe version of the Acetabular Cup is the angle of the Acetabular Reamer Handle or Cup Impactor relative to the coronal plane (radiographic version). Unlike anatomic version measured relative to the pelvic frontal plane, the radiographic version value displayed in the MAKOplasty Total Hip Application accounts for the individual patient's pelvic tilt by using the CT table top as its coronal plane reference. Positive numbers represent anteversion and negative numbers represent retroversion.",

A positive value (anteversion) is displayed\nwhen the neck axis is angled anteriorly relative to the\nepicondylar axis. A negative value (retroversion) is\ndisplayed when the neck axis is angled posteriorly.\n\n- Checkpoints\n\nHardware checkpoints are inserted into the femur and pelvis that are used as a fixed point in the\nbone relative to an array. By placing the probe in the checkpoint, the MAKOplasty Total Hip\nApplication can determine if an array has moved and possibly compromised the registration\naccuracy. If an array has moved more than 1 mm in relation to the checkpoint, the registration is no\nlonger acceptable and the final cup orientation can be off by more than 2 mm and 5 degrees.\n\nThe purpose of checkpoints within the application for reaming and impaction are used to confirm\nthat the base array on the RIO has not moved. If the base array has moved more than 2.0 mm, the\ncheckpoint will not pass and the RIO must be re-registered.\n\n- VIZADISC\n\nVIZADISC are the optical trackers that attach to the MAKOplasty Hip Arrays. These allow the\ncamera to view the position of the arrays in the OR.\n\n- MPS (Mako Product Specialist)\n\nMPS stands for Mako Product Specialist (MPS), or the Stryker representative responsible for\nrunning the MAKOplasty Total Hip Application during surgery.\n\n- Registration\n\nRegistration is the process of correlating the 3D model of the patient created from the pre-operative\nCT scan to the patient's anatomy on the OR table by taking points in selected locations on the\npatient's anatomy.\n\n- PIP Window\n\nPIP stands for 'picture in picture' and is used on the 'Implant Planning' page to display the\n'Transverse' and 'Sagittal' views.",

INDICATIONS FOR USE\n\nFor indications and contraindications specific to the selected implant components, please reference the implant specific Instructions for Use.\n\n## 4. PATIENT SELECTION\n\nPatient selection for a total hip replacement depends on the judgment of the surgeon with regard to the requirements of the patient. Prior to MAKOplasty THA, the surgeon should consider the following:\n\n- The surgeon should become thoroughly familiar with the technique of implantation for total hip surgery:\n  - by appropriate reading of the literature, and\n  - by training in the operative skills and techniques required for total hip replacement surgery.\n- Metal in the operative or non-operative leg can lead to the creation of accuracy-reducing artifacts in the CT scan, which can adversely affect the operative plan.\n- The presence of infection (including history of infection), acute or chronic, local or systemic must be considered.\n\nThe operative surgeon has the final decision in choosing recipients of the MAKOplasty Total Hip procedure. The effectiveness of all hip implants can be reduced by improper patient selection.\n\n## 5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nFamiliarity with and attention to appropriate surgical technique for Total Hip Arthroplasty is essential for success of the procedure.\n\nOnly surgeons who have reviewed the literature regarding Total Hip Arthroplasty and have had training in the technique using RIO should perform the procedure.\n\nThe surgeon or his/her designee should instruct the patients in the limitations of Total Hip Arthroplasty, and patients should be taught to govern their activities accordingly.\n\nImplants and trial components from different manufacturers or different implant systems should not be used together since articular and dimensional compatibility cannot be assured.\n\nThe use of the MAKOplasty Total Hip Application in any configuration requires the use of the RIO. For more details on using the RIO, see the RIO System User Guide (PN 210711) and the MAKOplasty THA Application User Guide (PN 210555).\n\nFor warnings and precautions specific to the selected implant components, please reference the implant specific Instructions for Use.",

PRE-OPERATIVE REQUIREMENTS\n\n### A. CT Scan\n\nEach patient requires a pre-operative CT scan for the MAKOplasty Total Hip procedure. This scan must follow the protocol in the Mako THA CT Scanning Protocol (PN 204890).\n\n### B. Patient Specific Bone Model and Pre-Plan\n\nOnce the CT scan has been completed, the Segmentation Team at Stryker creates a patient specific virtual 3D model of the pelvis and femur. Using the surgeon's preferences, the Segmentation Team will also create an initial pre-plan and select the CT landmarks.\n\nPrior to the procedure, the MPS reviews the plan with the surgeon to ensure the location of the CT landmarks are optimal and the plan is correct. During the Patient Time Out, the surgeon validates and accepts all pre-operative planning that was recorded for the procedure and agrees to have read and understood the MAKOplasty Total Hip Application Surgical Technique.\n\n> It is possible to create and export a patient plan using a different software version than the application which opens the plan. In this situation, a message appears on screen informing the user of the version mismatch. The application will modify the plan by converting to the current software version with the option to 'Continue' or 'Abort'.\n\n> If the planned implant system is not available, the application will display the 'Implant Selection' dialog for a list of available implant systems. The newly selected implant system will require re-planning.\n\n> Refer to the application release notes to ensure version compatibility.\n\n> Bone Model images change depending upon the implant system selected. Images shown in this Surgical Technique may differ from images displayed during an actual procedure.",

Patient Positioning and Surgical Approach\n\nThe goal of the surgical approach is to establish adequate visualization of the anatomy so that the entire surgical area is exposed. The MAKOplasty Total Hip Application is designed to accommodate the Posterolateral, Anterolateral and Direct Anterior surgical approaches with Enhanced or Express Femoral Workflow. The operative surgeon is responsible for the location, type and size of the incision appropriate for a MAKOplasty Total Hip procedure.\n\nFor the lateral approaches, the patient should be placed in a full lateral position and secured with positioning devices anterior and posterior against the pelvis and anterior and posterior against the chest. Patient stability is critical to facilitate acetabular reaming and cup implantation.\n\n### Femoral Workflow\n\nTwo different femoral workflows can be chosen depending on surgeons preference:\n\n**Enhanced Femoral Workflow:** Gives the user access to all available features of the MAKOplasty Total Hip Application including accurate neck resection placement, broach and stem tracking (version measurements), combined anteversion display, and real-time reduced hip length and combined offset display, but requires placement of the cortical array screw, the femoral array, and femoral registration.\n\n**Express Femoral Workflow:** Allows the user to capture Hip Length (HL) and Combined Offset (OS) of the reduced hip relative to pre-operative and the opposite hip without the need for a cortical array screw, femoral array, the femoral registration process, or reduced hip center capture. Through careful selection of a proximal landmark on the Greater Trochanter and a distal landmark on the patellar surface prior to dislocation and at trial and/or final reduction, the Express Femoral workflow can accurately display reduced hip length and offset.\n\n*Stem Tracking is not available with the Direct Anterior Surgical Approach.",

Distal Landmark Placement\n\nThe Distal Landmark is required for Express Femoral Workflow only.\n\n\nThe operative setup for placing the distal landmark for all surgical approaches is as follows:\n\n1. Prior to washing and prep, flex the knee of the operative side 90 degrees and locate the patient's patella. Depending on the setup (i.e., for the Direct Anterior approach), 90 degrees of knee flexion may not be possible. Flex the knee as much as possible until the patella is stable.\n\n2. Place an EKG tab centered on the patella or slightly inferior to the center. The EKG tab location should be in line with the anatomic axis of the femur.\n\n3. Place sterile Tegaderm, OpSite bandage or alternative atop EKG tab to retain stability.\n\n4. Sterile prep and drape in normal fashion (Stockinette, Coban, etc.), ensuring that the EKG tab can still be palpated for landmark capture during the procedure. It is recommended that the knee be wrapped in Coban either underneath or above the Stockinette to further improve stability of the EKG tab.\n\n5. Manage all sterility concerns keeping in mind the probe used to capture this landmark will also be placed in the wound during the procedure.\n\nAlternative Method:\n\n2. After washing and with the patient in the appropriate position (lateral decubitus position for anterolateral/posterolateral and supine for Direct Anterior), flex the knee of the operative side 90 degrees and locate the patient's patella. Depending on the setup (i.e., for the Direct Anterior approach), 90 degrees of knee flexion may not be possible. Flex the knee as much as possible until the patella is somewhat stable.\n\n3. Prepare operative leg extending the accessible sterile field to below the knee.\n\n4. With sterile surgical marker, mark a small dot on the skin at the center to slightly inferior portion of the patella. For added protection, a sterile bandage, telfa pad or wound dressing can be placed atop the patella and marked instead.\n\n5. Place Tegaderm or Ioban atop the marked point or bandage to reduce the likelihood of the landmark location moving during the procedure. Ensure the marked dot is still visible for probing during the procedure. Do not extend the stockinette or drape above the knee to keep the marked point visible throughout the surgery.",

Manage all sterility concerns keeping in mind the probe used to capture this landmark will also be\nplaced in the wound during the procedure.\n\nAs long as the Distal Landmark can be placed on the patella and be repeatedly and accurately\ncaptured prior to and after hip implantation without landmark movement, there are a number of\nmethods that could be employed depending on the preference of the surgeon and OR staff. It is the\nresponsibility of the surgeon and OR staff to manage any sterility concerns knowing that the sterile\nprobe used to capture the distal landmark will also be placed within the incision at several steps of\nthe procedure.\n\n## C. Pelvic Array Placement\n\n\nTo ensure proper fixation of the Pelvic Array, it is recommended that dry gloves be used when\nassembling the Pelvic Clamps to the bone pins.\n\nThe Express Femoral Workflow requires that the Pelvic Array be placed prior to Femoral Landmark\ncapture and dislocation of the native hip. Once the initial femoral landmarks are captured, the Pelvic\nArray cannot be moved or reoriented until after final reduction results. It is recommended that the\nsurgeon place and capture the Pelvic Checkpoint prior to Femoral Landmark capture. If it is believed\nthat the Pelvic Array has moved or if the Pelvic Checkpoint fails verification between Femoral\nLandmark and Reduction Results capture, hip length and offset values may not be accurate.\n\n\n### Bone Pin Insertion\n\nThe MAKOplasty Total Hip Instrument Kit includes a drill adapter for inserting bone pins. However, a\npower drill can be fitted with either a Jacobs chuck or a cannulated 4 mm bone pin driver, if desired.\n\n### Iliac Crest (out of wound placement):\n\nPrior to the start of a case, the OR staff should consider the\nplacement (Intra-Incision Tracking or Iliac Crest Tracking)\nand method in which they will be inserting bone pins.\n\nContralateral iliac crest tracking is required for Direct\nAnterior surgical approach.\n\n1. Make a stab incision along the lateral aspect of the iliac\ncrest based on the surgical approach (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n2. Load a bone pin into the Drill Adapter to drive the pin from the lateral to medial aspect of the bone.\n\nConfirm the stability of the inserted bone pin before proceeding.\n\n3. Use the 3-Pin Pelvic Clamp to align the second pin or as a guide for proper spacing. Make a second\nstab incision at the proper site and insert the second bone pin.\n",

Impact or push the Femoral Checkpoint into place ensuring that it is secure and accessible.\n\n## E. Femoral Registration\n\n### Enhanced Femoral Workflow\n\nBone registration has three distinct steps:\n1) Patient Landmarks, 2) Fine Registration, and 3) Registration Verification.\n\n1. Patient Landmarks: Collect all femoral landmarks identified in the software within 5 mm using the probe (Figure 11). The placement of landmarks vary by surgical approach. These landmarks are identified pre-operatively in the 'Femoral CT Landmarks' page and are required to properly orient the femur.\n\n\n> Landmark positions taken on the patient's bone must match what is selected within the application.\n\n2. Fine Registration: Using the Probe, touch the surface of the bone in the required areas of the proximal femur identified in the software (Figure 12, Figure 13, and Figure 14).",

Proximal and Distal Femoral Checkpoints\n\n### Express Femoral Workflow\n\nWarning: Pelvic Array placement is necessary prior to Proximal and Distal Femoral Checkpoint capture during the Express Femoral Workflow. Once the initial femoral checkpoints are captured, the Pelvic Array cannot be moved or reoriented until after final reduction results. If it is believed that the pelvic array may have moved between Femoral Checkpoints and Reduction Results capture, check the Pelvic Checkpoint. If the Pelvic Checkpoint fails verification, hip length and offset values may not be accurate.\n\n\nProximal and Distal Femoral Checkpoint captures are required prior to initial dislocation for the Express Femoral Workflow.\n\n1. If not previously inserted, place the Pelvic Checkpoint, capture, and verify its location.\n\n2. Allow the reduced femur to rest without traction in a position with the mechanical axis of the femur approximately parallel to the long axis of the pelvis and patient with the knee flexed approximately 90 degrees. (Figure 16 represents the image display for AL or PL approaches on a right hip; images on the screen will differ slightly for a left hip or for the DA approach.)\n\nDepending on patient setup for the Direct Anterior approach, it may not be possible to obtain 90 degrees of knee flexion. Keeping the femur parallel to the table, flex the knee as much as possible to keep the patella stable and align the Distal Checkpoint with the anatomic axis of the femur.\n\n\n\nWarning: During Femoral Checkpoint acquisition, the femur cannot move between the Proximal and Distal Checkpoint captures. Ensure the femur is stable and both checkpoints are accessible before proceeding. If it is perceived that the femur may have moved between captures, select 'Clear All' and repeat both landmark captures.\n\n\n3. With the 'Proximal Checkpoint' radio button selected, collect the Proximal Femoral landmark point by placing the probe in the Proximal Femoral Checkpoint, facing the Probe Array toward the camera, and selecting 'Capture'.\n\n4. Without moving the femur, place the probe on the Distal Femoral Checkpoint with a light touch and at a slight angle to avoid pushing through the sterile dressings. Ensure the Probe Array is facing the camera, and select 'Capture'.\n\nWarning: The application defaults to the Proximal Checkpoint capture first. The Distal Checkpoint can be captured first; however, the user MUST manually select the Distal Checkpoint radio button prior to capture.\n\n\n\nThe Foot Switch may be used to collect the Femoral Checkpoints. With the probe on the proper checkpoint, press and release the Foot Switch once. To 'Clear All', the button must be selected manually with the mouse.\n",

Femoral Neck Resection (Optional)\n\n\nGuided Neck Resection applies only to Enhanced Femoral Workflow. For the Express Femoral Workflow, see 'Manual Femoral Preparation' section below using the Neck Resection Guide and the 2D measurement tool in 'Stem Plan Mode'.\n\n\n1. Based on the planned position of the femoral stem, the proximal level of the coating will be displayed as a green line on a 3D model of the femur.\n\n\nThe displayed green line for cemented stems (e.g., Exeter) indicates a generic level that may or may not be used based on the specific surgical technique.\n\n\n2. With the Femoral Array inserted in the Femoral Cortical Screw, bring the probe into view. The location of the probe tip will appear on screen.\n\n\n\n3. Mark the neck resection line on the bone with an electrocautery tool or a surgical marker according to the implant specific surgical technique. Orientation of the green line may not match the preferred surgical technique and should be used only as a guide. Use of the medial resection may be helpful in finding the appropriate height of the cut.\n\n4. Remove the Femoral Array and resect the femoral neck with a bone saw along the marked line, taking care to maintain the correct angle. In the 'Neck Resection' page, a 3D model of the registered bone will be displayed along with the illustrated neck resection line (green).\n\n\n\nAfter resecting the femoral head, reattach the Femoral Array and use the probe to verify the neck cut was made in the correct location.\n\n\nA corkscrew is provided in the Direct Anterior instrument kit to facilitate the removal of the femoral head after resection.\n\n\n## H.

These landmarks are required to properly orient the pelvis prior to registration and are the locations collected pre-operatively in the CT Pelvic Landmarks.\n\n\n\n> Registration accuracy is dependent on probing landmarks intra-operatively as close as possible to their locations selected in the 'CT Landmarks' page. Choosing a point on the CT that can be easily reproduced on the actual pelvis (bumps, valleys, etc.) in the approximate area described is recommended. Choosing points on the CT at both the inferior tips of the articular surface (horseshoe) beyond the cartilage is also recommended.\n\n> Best Practice: Excise the labrum before acetabular registration such that the rim points are collected on the bone. If the labrum is ossified, register behind this osteophyte.\n\n2. Using the probe, touch the surface of the bone in the required areas of the acetabulum and outside the superior acetabular rim identified in the software (Figure 23).\n\n   The larger the amount of area covered by the points, the better the registration (pelvic registration error should be less than or equal to 0.5 mm).\n\n   The surgeon must verify the registration by placing the probe on the surface of the bone in the critical areas of the acetabulum identified in the software (Figure 24).\n\n\n\n3. Capture a point in the area of each large blue verification sphere – if the registration error is less than 1 mm, the sphere will become white indicating an accurate registration. If the registration error for the region is greater than 1 mm, the sphere will turn red.\n",

Reaming can be accomplished with either a single reamer or multiple reamers.\n\n\n## Multiple Ream Option\n\nIf multiple reamers are used, begin with a reamer 4 mm or smaller than the planned cup size. A reamer size 4 mm or smaller will allow the surgeon to orient the Robotic Arm in any desired position (no orientation constraints, but center of rotation is still constrained). A reamer size within 3 mm of the desired final reamer will prohibit the Robotic Arm from moving more than 15 degrees from the desired cup plan for inclination or anteversion. Therefore, if the surgeon wants to initially ream away the ridge of the acetabulum (lunate bone) or ream transversely to remove osteophytes, a reamer size 4 mm or smaller than the planned cup size should initially be attached to the effector arm.\n\n> Avoid reaming too deep with smaller reamer sizes.

If mallet blows are not advancing the cup, further reaming of the acetabulum may be\nrequired or acetabular fracture may occur.\n\n\n6. Before removing the Impactor, assess the cup stability in the acetabulum by placing the RIO into\n‘Free Mode’. Inspect the acetabular cup and verify it is seated by palpating through one of the three\nscrew holes in the cup with the tip of a tonsil clamp.\n\n\nPerforming acetabular resection with the RIO may result in differences in press-fit as compared to a\nmanual procedure. Assess the press-fit between the acetabular implant and the reamed acetabulum\nbefore impaction by using a trial cup if desired to assess implant press-fit. This maneuver will reduce\nthe potential of an acetabular fracture.\nWhile the ‘Cup Impaction’ page controls inclination and version of the cup component, depth of\nimpaction must be controlled by the operating surgeon.\nUsing the ‘Capture’ feature will collect the current inclination and version of the cup component as a\nfunction of the angle held by the impaction shaft. An alternate final method of calculating the\ninclination and anteversion is available by using the cup plane feature on the ‘Surgical Results’ page.\nThis is obtained by touching the metal rim of the cup five times.\nThe ’Reduction Results’ page uses the cup center obtained from the data of the final acquired\n‘Capture Values’ in calculation of reduced hip length and combined offset. Ensure the correct cup\nsize is selected, the cup is seated, and the End Effector is pushed fully down when acquiring the last\n‘Capture Values’.\nWhen the Robotic Arm transitions from impaction haptic mode into ‘Free’ state, the arm will move\nwhich may cause a change in the arm orientation affecting inclination and version values.",

If the Impacted Cup Center values appear suspect or the cup was manually impacted subsequent to or in place of RIO impaction, proceed by selecting the 'Capture Hip Center' button and following the steps in the next section.\n\n## Using 'Capture Hip Center' to Obtain Hip Length and Combined Offset\n\n1.

Ensure both the Pelvic and Femoral Array are visible to the camera.\n\n4. Press the 'Capture Hip Center' button. The screen will display an image of a rotating femur and a progress bar.\n\n5. Keeping the implant or trial femoral head reduced in the acetabular cup and both arrays visible, pivot the femur until the progress bar on the bottom of the screen reaches 100%. If the arrays are blocked during capture, collection will stop but will resume when the arrays are made visible again. Move the leg into 25 degrees flexion, 25 degrees abduction, and full extension while rotating it to record the center into the software being careful to avoid impingement of the femoral array post on the incision edges.\n\n6. A sound will play and the hip length and combined offset values will be displayed in the 'Actual' column when enough data has been captured. If the femoral head does not remain fully seated in the acetabular liner during the capture of the hip center, an error message will display informing the user to recapture the hip center. If this occurs, be sure to apply constant superior pressure to the femoral head during the kinematic to ensure it remains fully seated in the cup for the duration of the kinematic step. Head displacement occurs mostly with flexion and adduction, to avoid adduction angles greater than 25 degrees. If head displacement is persistent, the hip is probably too short. Also, if the value will not record, check stability of femoral cortical screw.\n\n7. Review the final hip length and combined offset values expressed in millimeters. If a new modular head is used or the final head is impacted, it is only necessary to reattach the array to the femoral cortical screw in order to obtain the leg length and offset values (it is NOT necessary to rotate the leg again).\n\n## Manual Assessment and Adjustments\n\n1. Manually, confirm that the proper biomechanical reconstruction (leg length and offset) has been achieved by the surgeon's traditional method. Confirm that the femoral cortical screw is not loose\n",

If the screw is not loose, an excessively low or high value will be an indication for the surgeon to trial the leg with a different femoral head length.\n\n\nWhile displayed hip length and combined offset values after successful capture are accurate, the 3D models shown are for display only. The neck resection, the implant location, and orientation shown on the screen may differ from their actual physical locations.\n\nIt is recommended that the surgeon manually verifies the inclination and version of the final cup placement to meet the planned inclination and combined anteversion values. The patient's offset and leg length should also be verified manually. Returning to the 'Implant Planning' page in order to visualize the 3D planned cup position relative to the acetabular rim may be helpful in assessing the proper orientation of the cup.\n\nFailed pelvic or RIO registration, failed checkpoint verification, or abnormalities of the visualization of the reamer or cup during acetabular preparation requires that on-screen results of inclination, version, and offset and leg length must be ignored and the surgeon should proceed without utilizing the RIO.\n\n2. Adjust to a shorter or longer head length or neck length as needed.\n\nIf the surgeon makes any adjustments to the acetabular cup or liner after capturing the Hip Center, the Hip Center must be recaptured to ensure accurate Hip Length and Combined Offset values.\n\n3.

The old plan will be overwritten. The 'Undo' button may be used, but only the latest (new) plan will be applied when returning to the 'Cup Reaming' and 'Cup Impaction' pages.\n- Any change which decreases the depth of the implant into the acetabulum will not be represented in the software (i.e., removed bone cannot be restored).\n\nCare must be taken when choosing to adjust the Cup Plan after acetabular reaming has taken place.

Selecting 'Continue' will return the screen to the 'Reduction Results' page, but displayed Hip Length (HL) and Combined Offset (OS) values may not be accurate.",

After registration of the acetabulum, remove any osteophytes over the Transverse Acetabular Ligament (TAL) or it will force the reamer superiorly and prevent activation of power.\n\n2. With a single reamer technique in hard or sclerotic bone, especially with osteophytes on the acetabular rim or covering the cotyloid notch, it may be necessary to manually ream for the first 3-4 mm if the Robotic Arm power does not activate. Once this completes, continue to ream with the Robotic Arm constraint engaged.\n\n3. If the shell does not fully seat (within 0-2 mm proud), the operative surgeon may consider removing the cup to ensure the acetabular ridge is completely reamed away. Commonly, some of the posterior ridge bone will remain. In this case, medialize the software plan to ream 2 more mm and re-ream the cavity.\n\nIt is important to note that if the \"distance remaining\" during shell impaction is 2 mm proud or greater, the stability of the cup should be verified. A \"distance remaining\" value of 2 mm or more can lead to a zone 2 gap between the acetabular bone and the dome of the acetabular cup that is visible on the post-operative x-ray.\n\nAnother reason for incomplete seating of the shell can be a mismatch between the tolerance of the reamer size and shell size (1 mm difference is possible). In this situation, the cup is difficult to seat beyond 4 mm from the floor of the acetabulum. Re-ream the acetabulum with a reamer size 1 mm bigger and again impact the shell into it. Adjunct screw fixation may be required.",
