      "raw_content": "## Preoperative planning\n\n### Step 1\n\nPre-operative planning aids in the determination of probable implant style and size. The pre-operative planning process should take qualitative and quantitative factors (including patient bone quality, density, and morphology) into consideration in order to evaluate and select the appropriate implant system for the patient. Digital templates are available for use.\n\n### Determining leg length\n\nWith the templates provided, determine the desired postoperative leg length, taking into consideration radiographic leg length inequality and patient clinical assessment.\n\nFor example, if 8mm of leg lengthening is required to equalize the leg lengths, make a new mark 8mm superior to the center of rotation marked during templating of the acetabular shell. This new mark will be your target when templating the femoral stem (described below).\n\nIn this example, if this plan is properly executed at the time of surgery, there will be 8mm of leg lengthening.\n\nSimilarly, the predicted change in offset is also considered by comparing the relative medial/ lateral position of the center of rotation marking of the acetabular component and new mark used to plan the femoral component. The digital templates should be used to estimate the final components that most closely restore the normal offset of the patient's hip.\n\n### Tips:\n\n- Templating is an important aspect of pre-operative planning, but it should only serve as a guide. Final decision making concerning fit, size, and soft tissue tensioning should take place intra-operatively at the surgeon's discretion.\n- The templated stem size and neck resection level may have to be adjusted if leg length cannot be managed solely by changing the head offset.\n- Patient positioning is key to obtaining adequate hip stability and acetabular placement.\n- Standing pre-operative x-rays are recommended. Both an A/P and lateral x-ray are preferred to assess stem size.\n- To help facilitate correct placement of final implants, take into account any pelvic tilt observed.\n\n### Acetabular cup position and sizing\n\nUtilize the acetabular templates to determine the optimal position and size for the acetabular component. Be sure the cup is well centered in the acetabulum and the size fills between the tear drop and the superior rim (Figure 1). After templating, mark the center of rotation.\n\n### Femoral stem selection\n\nInsignia has two offset options for each size: Standard and High Offset. Refer to page 15 for more information on sizing options. High Offset is designed to provide 5mm of direct lateralization, increasing offset without changing leg length.\n\nChoose the template for which the stem size achieves medio-lateral cortical engagement at the proximal two-thirds of the stem and recreates the desired leg length and offset. For both Standard and High Offset options, the template has markings that indicate the center of the femoral head for a range of head offset options.\n\nThrough templating and trialing, determine which option restores proper offset and center of rotation by matching the cup's center of rotation with the desired head center of rotation of either the Standard or High Offset stem.\n\nOnce the final estimated stem size and position is determined, the neck resection level should be noted. This will be used as a reference during intra-operative neck resection.\n",

      "raw_content": "## Broaching\n### Step 4\n\nInsignia is designed to be compatible with several broach handle designs to ease insertion in various surgical approaches.\n\nBroaching is performed beginning with the size 0 broach. The broach should be inserted via canal access by positioning the broach laterally and posteriorly. Insignia was designed to be inserted parallel to the posterior cortical bone of the femoral neck although adjustments can be made by the surgeon during insertion based on patient need.\n\nSequentially broach upward in size until the proper fit is achieved. The surgeon's clues to a firm fit and final size include 1.) increased resistance to forward advancement; 2.) changing pitch of sound that results from mallet blows to the broach handle; 3.) lack of further motion, and 4.) rotational stability as assessed with broach handle in place.\n\nUpon reaching the final size and depth of the broach, detach the broach handle from the broach, leaving the broach fully seated in the femoral canal (Figure 4, Figure 5).\n\n### Tips:\n- The neck resection should be about 1-2 mm above the final broach height. This will allow for calcar planing prior to final implant placement enhancing collar contact with medial bone.\n- Relying only on the neck resection height alone for final seating height may lead to improper sizing and inadequate component fixation.\n- For good fixation of the implant, it is important to maintain rotational alignment throughout the broaching process.\n- For broach handles featuring a lever design, close the lever arm until the broach is secured onto the Broach Handle.\n- For broach handles featuring a lever design, to open the lever with one hand place your thumb on the top edge of the impaction pad and your index finger in the notch under the end of the lever. Use your index finger to pull up on the lever.\n\n### Broach handle styles Insignia is compatible with:\n1. Extra Offset Broach Handle – Lever\n(7000-5529)\n2. Straight Broach Handle – Lever\n(7000-5525)\n3. Offset Broach Handle – Lever\n(7000-5526)\n4. Straight Broach Handle\n(1440-1460)\n5. Offset Broach Handle\n(1020-1460)\n6. Dual Offset Broach Handle\n(Left: 1440-2000; Right: 1440-2001)\n\n### Note: \nInsignia broaches can be properly identified through the following:\n\n1) The size is marked on the top of the broach post.\n2) The size is marked in the tab slot.\n3) 8000-77xx part number.\n\n",

The High Offset option is designed to provide 5mm of direct offset without changing leg length.\n\nThe table below indicates the correct neck trial color code for each stem size. The High Offset neck trials feature a gold TiN coating (Figure 7).\n\nAssemble the Neck Trial onto the broach. Next, assemble a V40 Head Trial onto the Neck Trial. Femoral heads come in multiple options and are different for each femoral head implant material (see table below). For this reason, final head material should be chosen prior to trial reduction. Offsets add or subtract from the base neck length of the implant and help to achieve the desired leg length and offset.\n\nPerform a trial reduction of the hip. The final broach size facilitates determination of the correct implant size. Upon confirmation of the selected components, note selected neck offset, femoral head, and broach size.",

This aids in positioning the implant in the same orientation that was broached, preventing the stem from being forced into a different position.\n\nSeveral stem inserters are available to help facilitate various surgical approaches.\n\n#### Option 1 – Modular Offset Quick Connect Stem Inserter (1020-1860)\n\nInsignia can be inserted using the Modular Offset Quick Connect Stem Inserter. Place tip of the inserter into the drive hole of the stem taking care to align the version tab on the inserter with the slot in the stem (Figure 9). The quick connect design provides the inserter with a stable spring connection, providing rotational control during stem implantation, but it does not provide a mechanical lock. Therefore, this assembly should be handled with care, as excessive shaking or motion may result in the stem disassociating from the inserter.\n\n**Note:** For Size 0 and Size 1 Insignia stems, use the Modular Stem Impactor or Modular Threaded Stem Inserter. The Modular Offset Quick Connect Stem Inserter cannot be used. Misuse could lead to instrument failure.\n\n#### Option 2 – Modular Stem Impactor (1020-1870)\n\nThe Modular Stem Impactor has a spherical tip, which is placed onto the drive hole of the stem. This instrument allows for off-axis impaction of the stem, if needed. The Modular Stem Impactor does not connect to the stem, and, therefore, can only be used for final impaction of the stem.\n\n#### Option 3 – Modular Threaded Stem Inserter (1020-1800)\n\nIf using the Modular Threaded Stem Inserter, thread the Modular Threaded Stem Inserter into the drive hole on the proximal face of the stem. The inserter should be fully threaded and secured to the stem prior to impaction to help prevent damage to the threads on the implant or the instrument. This inserter is designed to provide rotational control during stem implantation. The inserter is designed to provide rotational control during stem implantation.",

If the collar is sitting proud, do not attempt to continue impacting the stem if visual and auditory clues indicate that it is firmly seated in the canal. These clues, rather than the collar seating level, should be used to determine the final seating height of the implant. Continued aggressive impaction could lead to femoral fracture.\n\nIn the event that dense bone is encountered intra-operatively and compounding anatomical factors are present, the seating of the implant may not be consistent with the level of the broach due to the viscoelastic nature of the femoral bone.* If the final seating height is undesirable, the implant can be removed and additional broaching can be performed.\n\n**Tip:** Use moderate mallet strikes/blows to seat the stem until it is stable.\n\nIf the stem hangs up due to impingement of the Modular Threaded Stem Inserter against the overhanging tip of the greater trochanter, remove the threaded stem inserter leaving the stem in place and use the Modular Stem Impactor to fully seat the stem.\n\n**Warning:**\n- If any intra-operative stem extraction is required, utilize the Modular Threaded Stem Inserter (1020-1800).\n- If the stem inserter is contacting the greater trochanter during insertion, continued impaction could lead to a fracture.",

Remove the Head Trial and dry the implant trunnion with a sponge or sterile towel.\n\nSelect the appropriate corresponding V40 Femoral Head (BIOLOX delta Ceramic, CoCr, Alumina Ceramic) or sleeve and place it onto the dry trunnion of the femoral stem with a slight twist. Impact the head with two moderate impactions using the Modular Head Impactor (1601-1700) (Figure 11).\n\nVerify the head is secure on the trunnion after head impaction by applying traction to the head and confirming stability on the trunnion. If necessary, the head can be removed utilizing a head disassembly instrument (6059-9-505).*\n\nRelocate the femoral head into the acetabular cup and re-check the hip biomechanics. The surgical site is then closed according to surgeon preference.\n\n*If a ceramic head is placed on the trunnion and then removed, it must be replaced with a V40 cobalt chrome head or a V40 Titanium Adapter Sleeve (17-0000E) and a C-Taper ceramic head.\n\nIf the stem must be removed, utilize the Modular Threaded Stem Inserter (1020-1800).\n\n### Warning:\n\n- Following trial reduction and prior to final head assembly, clean and dry the implant to ensure the taper is free of debris. Finally, clean the bearing surfaces and reduce the hip.\n- Any debris that is potentially generated must be fully lavaged prior to wound closure.\n\nAfter completing the trialing process, intra-operatively assemble the adaptor sleeve to the femoral stem manually. The Universal Adaptor Sleeve must be fully seated on the stem taper before the head is assembled.\n\n**Note:** In no instance should any attempt be made to pre-assemble the adaptor sleeve inside the BIOLOX delta Universal Ceramic Head.\nIntra-operatively assemble the BIOLOX delta Universal Taper Ceramic Head onto the sleeved femoral stem and set with two moderate strikes using the Stem Head Impactor (1104-1000).
