Combined with Trident II and MDM, you’re poised to elevate the standard of care for hips.\n\n# Stryker Orthopaedics Modeling and Analytics\n\nInsignia continues Stryker’s heritage of 3D CT-based implant design through SOMA (Stryker Orthopaedics Modeling and Analytics) technology, the world’s largest collection of high-resolution CT-based scans of upper and lower extremities. SOMA’s unparalleled bone database is leveraged through an intelligent, 3D modeling software system that allows Stryker to instantaneously test how an implant fits different types of anatomies, from bones with tight distal canals to bones with thin cortices.\n\nFirst used in Accolade II with its size-specific medial curvature, SOMA allowed Stryker to design and test unique implant features to allow for an enhanced implant fit across various femoral morphologies.\n\nInsignia is your collared, metaphyseal-filling stem, designed using SOMA* to provide one simple option for all bone types.\n\n# Addressing today’s needs for tomorrow’s patients\n\nToday’s THA landscape has shifted dramatically over the past decade with muscle-sparing approaches, like Direct Anterior, now accounting for approximately 45% of performed procedures.¹ Simultaneously, healthcare has shifted to combined payment models and new sites of care, like ambulatory surgical centers, which have experienced an increasing demand for patients to be discharged in less than 24 hours.\n\nMany current femoral stem designs predate the emergence of this novel demand. Short, fully HA coated stems have achieved popularity due to their simplicity and ease of insertion. Incidences of proximal-distal mismatch, distal potting, collar overhang, subsidence, and periprosthetic fracture suggest a need for a data-driven implant to enhance implant fit across today’s patient population.3,4,5\n\n\nWith this goal in mind, Stryker set out to create an implant which capitalizes on the clinically successful designs of Accolade II and Secur-Fit to meet the unique needs of today’s patient population and muscle-sparing approaches.2,6,7 The result: the Insignia Hip Stem.\n\n",
