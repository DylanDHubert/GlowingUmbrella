# Single radius clinical outcomes

## Gait study
In a study that compared three cohorts of 16 patients
who received single radius TKAs or multi-radius TKAs to
healthy control knees, patients who received single radius
TKA exhibited gait that more closely mimicked that of a
healthy control knee.


## Functional outcomes study

In a study of 559 TKAs, KSS knee and function subscores for the single radius design showed an advantage over the multi-radius design as measured by pain, stability, flexion, ability to completely straighten the knee, stair climbing, walking and the amount of support needed from an assistive device.

**Keywords:** FlexRod, femoral component, sizing, fit, oversizing, CT scan, rigid rod, flexible rod

# Sizing and fit with FlexRod

- Oversizing of the femoral component may lead to ML overhang. ≥3 mm ML overhang of the femoral components has been shown to be associated with increased knee pain.
- A CT scan–based study showed that the use of the FlexRod allowed Triathlon to fit 99.4% of patients.
- A retrospective clinical study that analyzed the femoral implant sizes of 277 patients using the rigid IM rod and 364 patients using the FlexRod rod showed that FlexRod reduced the risk of oversizing the femoral component.

The Triathlon Condylar Stabilized (CS) Tibial Insert

# CS Tibial Insert

- 2 mm more anterior height compared to CR insert to provide anterior stability
- Alternative for patients with an incompetent or sacrificed PCL

# CS outcomes

- An in vivo investigation compared the intraoperative kinematics of CR, CS, and PS Triathlon inserts. For patients without intact PCLs, the Triathlon CS Inserts had a stable kinematic pattern that was similar to the Triathlon PS Insert.
- In a study with five-year follow-up of patients with a sacrificed PCL, patients who received a Triathlon CS Tibial Insert demonstrated excellent clinical outcomes that were comparable to the results obtained with the Triathlon PS Tibial Insert.
- In a short-term follow-up study of patients with intact PCL, patients who received Triathlon CR and CS Tibial Inserts showed no differences in clinical survivorship and functional outcomes.

- In a study of 172 difficult primary TKAs with two-year follow-up and 41 difficult primary TKAs with five-year follow-up, all patients had good to excellent Knee Society Scores with good ROM and pain relief. No aseptic loosening or post failure was reported throughout the period of follow-up.

## Universal Baseplate can be used with a stem extension

- A finite element analysis of the Universal Baseplate with a stem extension demonstrated a reduction of cement-implant interface compressive and shear stress when compared to a baseplate without a stem.

## Page 37: X3 Polyethylene

**Keywords:** X3 Polyethylene, mechanical strength, wear resistance, oxidation resistance, BMI

# X3 polyethylene

X3’s patented40 sequential irradiation and heat process allows for:

• Mechanical strength: Triathlon PS with X3 showed no mechanical
failures at minimum five years in two separate clinical studies.

• Wear resistance: The Australian Joint Registry data has
demonstrated a lower rate of revision due to loosening for highly
cross-linked polyethylene compared to conventional polyethylene,
indicating a potential long-term benefit of cross-linked polyethylene

• Oxidation resistance: X3 has demonstrated similar oxidation
resistance to virgin polyethylene.

• One study comparing X3 to conventional polyethylene showed that X3
had a significantly better survival rate among subsets of patients who
were younger than 60 years old and/or had a BMI greater than 35.
