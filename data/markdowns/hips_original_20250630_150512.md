## Page 4: Stryker Orthopaedics

**Keywords:** Stryker Orthopaedics, dual articulation system, Total Hip Arthroplasty, Low Friction Arthroplasty, Large Head Concept

The dual articulation system was based on the foundation of two orthopaedic concepts relating to Total Hip Arthroplasty. The following concepts are well-known and studied in the field.

1. Low Friction Arthroplasty (LFA) 
2. Large Head Concept

**Keywords:** Gilles Bousquet, dual articulation system, Low Friction Arthroplasty, Large Head Concept, University Hospital of St Etinenne



The initial dual articulation system was invented by Professor Bousquet at University Hospital of St Etinenne, France, in 1976.
His design was a marriage of the two well-known principles of:

1. Low Friction Arthroplasty 
2. Large Head Concept

Low Friction Arthroplasty

# The Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty (LFA)

The Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty (LFA) prosthesis has demonstrated both clinically and radiologically, that smaller diameter heads produce lower torque forces in the shell and consequently less wear.

# Small Heads:

Less sliding distance typically leads to less wear.

Inner head = femoral head

**Keywords:** Large Head Concept, Mckee-Farrar, Big Heads, Diameter, Stability


# Large Head Concept

Second, the large head concept from Mckee-Farrar recognizes that a large diameter bearing is inherently more stable than a smaller diameter head.

# Big Heads: (greater than 36mm)
- Range of motion
- Stability
- Surgeon Security
       - Cup position

**Keywords:** Hip Instability, Total Hip Arthroplasty, Dislocation Rates, Recurrent Dislocation, Risk Factors

AAOS 2013: WORLDWIDE PERSPECTIVE ON HIP INSTABILITY AFTER THA

# CURRENT INCIDENCE AND NATURAL HISTORY

# 15 Incidence of THA Instability

# Dislocation rates after primary THA

Varied rates reported, 0.3-10%

Woo and Morrey (1982), 3.2%

Incidence is highest in the first year with % increase/5 years for an approximate 7% risk by 25 years.

# Recurrent dislocation (2 or more episodes of dislocation)

Occurs in 10-60% of patients with first time dislocation.

# Risk factors for dislocation

- Patient-specific
- Surgical technique
- Surgeon
- Implant design
- Soft tissue integrity

“Specifically, hip instability continues to be problematic in a small subgroup of patients, and efforts are ongoing to further reduce the risk of THA dislocation.”

## Page 14: Two Points of Articulations

**Keywords:** ADM, MDM, dual mobility bearings, articulation, Effective Head


The ADM and MDM designs are dual mobility bearings with two points of articulation.

# Two Points of Articulations

The External Bearing Articulation: refers to the inside of the acetabular cup and the polyethylene insert, also known as the “Effective Head.” Helpful Hint: Bench top testing of dual mobility system demonstrated that the torque force required to move the Effective Head only occurred in certain degrees of motion. For example getting out of a chair, waking up stairs, getting off the toilet (Test Report 06-078 reference).

The Internal Bearing Articulation: refers to the Effective Head, inner surface of the acetabular liner, and the outer surface of the inner bearing, otherwise known as the femoral head component.

# Anatomic Dual Mobility

World Wide Launch in 2010

The ADM cup is a monoblock cobalt chrome alloy cup with plasma sprayed titanium surface overlaid with hydroxyapatite. This cup has a peripheral self-locking (PSL) 1.5mm press-fit.

The left and right ADM cups incorporate psoas cutouts designed to allow for relief between the acetabular shell rim and iliopsoas tendon.

**Keywords:** Anatomic Design, Large Head Technology, jump distance, hemispherical designs, anatomic purposes

# ADM

Feature:
- Anatomic Design: is more than a hemisphere, providing more than 180 degrees of coverage (in some areas)
- Large Head Technology


Benefit:
- STABILITY- Offers more than 2 times greater jump distance than competitive hemispherical designs with large head bearings which may allow for improved stability.



Helpful Hint: There are left and right cup shapes. The anatomic rim is greater than a hemisphere in some areas, and smaller in areas where noted by “valleys” for specific anatomic purposes.
