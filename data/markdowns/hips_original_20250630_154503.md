**Keywords:** Stryker, Insignia, SOMA, implant design, muscle-sparing approaches


# Data driven design

aligned to your approach

Founded on Stryker’s signature principles of implant fit, function and flexibility, Insignia is your collared, metaphyseal-filling hip stem designed specifically for muscle-sparing approaches. Combined with Trident II and MDM, you’re poised to elevate the standard of care for hips.

# Stryker Orthopaedics Modeling and Analytics

Insignia continues Stryker’s heritage of 3D CT-based implant design through SOMA (Stryker Orthopaedics Modeling and Analytics) technology, the world’s largest collection of high-resolution CT-based scans of upper and lower extremities. SOMA’s unparalleled bone database is leveraged through an intelligent, 3D modeling software system that allows Stryker to instantaneously test how an implant fits different types of anatomies, from bones with tight distal canals to bones with thin cortices.

First used in Accolade II with its size-specific medial curvature, SOMA allowed Stryker to design and test unique implant features to allow for an enhanced implant fit across various femoral morphologies.

Insignia is your collared, metaphyseal-filling stem, designed using SOMA* to provide one simple option for all bone types.

# Addressing today’s needs for tomorrow’s patients

Today’s THA landscape has shifted dramatically over the past decade with muscle-sparing approaches, like Direct Anterior, now accounting for approximately 45% of performed procedures.¹ Simultaneously, healthcare has shifted to combined payment models and new sites of care, like ambulatory surgical centers, which have experienced an increasing demand for patients to be discharged in less than 24 hours.

Many current femoral stem designs predate the emergence of this novel demand. Short, fully HA coated stems have achieved popularity due to their simplicity and ease of insertion. Incidences of proximal-distal mismatch, distal potting, collar overhang, subsidence, and periprosthetic fracture suggest a need for a data-driven implant to enhance implant fit across today’s patient population.3,4,5


With this goal in mind, Stryker set out to create an implant which capitalizes on the clinically successful designs of Accolade II and Secur-Fit to meet the unique needs of today’s patient population and muscle-sparing approaches.2,6,7 The result: the Insignia Hip Stem.

## Page 4: SOMA-designed body geometries and Stryker's legacy

**Keywords:** SOMA design, Insignia, Accolade II, Secur-Fit, Stryker's legacy, medial curvature, bone mineral density, survivorship rate

# Fit

# SOMA-designed body geometries

Founded on Stryker’s legacy of clinically successful and market leading stem designs, Insignia’s body geometry incorporates the SOMA design of Accolade II and the trapezoidal design of Secur-Fit to optimize cortical engagement and proximal fill.6,7

# Size-specific medial curvature

Insignia leverages Accolade II’s clinically successful Medial / Lateral (M/L) body geometry, including the size-specific medial curvature.6,8,9 This SOMA-designed* feature has demonstrated a more conforming proximal cortical fit for improved stability10,11 and maintained 100% bone mineral density of the medial calcar at 5 years.¹²

Accolade II’s features have driven it to become the market-leading tapered wedge stem¹³ in the U.S. with over 1 million stems implanted worldwide.¹⁴

## Page 5: Metaphyseal-filling design

**Keywords:** Insignia, Secur-Fit, Accolade II, metaphyseal-filling design, optimized A/P fill

Metaphyseal-filling design

Insignia builds upon the heritage of Omnifit and Secur-Fit that has defined Stryker’s fit and fill stems for decades. Since its first implantation in 1995, Secur-Fit has the lowest revision rates and the longest follow-up in the Australian Joint Registry at 20 years.⁶

Optimized A/P fill†

The Anterior / Posterior (A/P) body geometry of Insignia capitalizes on the trapezoidal design of Secur-Fit to enhance rotational and axial stability.⁷

The optimized A/P fill of Insignia prioritizes M/L fit prior to A/P filling of the femur. Insignia’s geometry is designed to be more bone preserving while enhancing initial stability compared to a clinically successful fit and fill stem.6,7,15

Insignia’s metaphyseal-filling geometry significantly reduced broaching effort compared to a traditional fit and fill stem.¹⁶

## Page 8: Adjunct Stability and Size-Specific Collar of Insignia

**Keywords:** Insignia, rotational stability, periprosthetic fracture, size-specific collar, Hydroxyapatite (HA) coating


# Function

# Adjunct stability

Periprosthetic fractures continue to be a major complication and concern during the early postoperative period due to costly hospital readmission requirements and a high one-year mortality rate.

With this in mind, enhancing rotational stability was a crucial objective in Insignia’s collared design. Studies have shown that a collar enables initial rotational implant stability and a reduced potential for periprosthetic fracture and subsidence when flush with the calcar.

# Size-specific collar

Insignia features a SOMA-designed, size-specific collar (5-7mm) to maximize calcar coverage, while minimizing overhang across various femoral morphologies.

Insignia’s collar sizes increase
proportionally to the implant body to
help minimize the likelihood of psoas
impingement from implant overhang. 

The underside of Insignia’s collar has 50 microns of HA coating over a grit-blasted surface to ensure flush collar contact to the calcar and a reproducible stem to final broach seating height.

# Purefix Hydroxyapetite (HA) coating

Insignia is fully HA coated with a 50-micron plasma sprayed of PureFix HA over plasma-sprayed commercially pure titanium proximally for fixation. Designed to balance fixation, the underside of the collar and distal stem tip feature an HA coating over a grit-blasted surface. Purefix HA has over 20 years of clinical experience and has demonstrated 95.3% survivorship in stems with 40-70 microns of coating.⁶

# Flexibility

# Advanced biomechanics

Balanced lateralization

The +5mm of direct lateral offset was designed to provide freedom of choice to use a standard or high offset stem without being limited on head offset size due to lateralization.

Proportional neck lengths and a robust head offset size range allow diverse options to further achieve your patient’s biomechanic goals.

36mm Biolox Delta Ceramic head offering: +7.5, +5, +2.5, 0, -2.5, -5

Direct lateral offset:

Stryker Insignia: +5mm
DePuy Synthes Actis: +6mm, +8mm
DePuy Synthes Corail: +7mm
Zimmer Biomet Avenir Complete: +6mm
Smith and Nephew Polarstem: +3.5mm



# Proportional neck lengths

Insignia incorporates neck lengths that grow incrementally relative to body size.

A constant neck length relies heavily on a large selection of femoral head lengths to recreate normal joint space, which could possibly lead to smaller stems using minus heads and the opposite on larger stems.

Insignia was designed with incremental neck lengths to achieve proper joint stability most often with a standard +0mm femoral head.

Proportional neck lengths (mm): 40.5, 38, 35, 32.5, 30.5
