# Introduction

The Trident® Constrained Acetabular Insert is indicated for use in primary and revision total hip patients who exhibit a high risk of hip dislocation. It should be used when more conservative methods of soft tissue management, such as lengthening the femoral neck or lateralizing the joint’s center of rotation, are insufficient for restoring joint stability.

The Trident® Constrained Acetabular Insert offers less range of motion than standard total hip replacement components but can be a better solution when the likelihood of dislocation is high.

The Trident® Constrained Acetabular Insert is designed specifically for the Stryker UHR® bipolar head. The bipolar head is preassembled in the insert and securely retained by a titanium alloy retaining ring. 
The Trident® 0° and 10°
Constrained Acetabular Inserts can only
be used in a Trident® Acetabular Shell.
The Trident® 0° All-Poly Constrained
Insert can be cemented into an existing
shell or cage device, or directly into the
acetabulum.

Articulation occurs at both the femoral head-to-bipolar interface and at the bipolar-to-insert interface.

A unique, split-ring locking mechanism
facilitates ease of femoral head assembly,
yet provides the potential for enhanced
protection against component
disassembly.
A head removal key allows for easy,
non-destructive component disassembly.

A dynamic valgus alignment creates a constant neutral alignment of the bipolar within the insert during weight bearing to provide increased head coverage. This prevents inner bearing articulation from occurring on the locking mechanism, thus sparing the mechanism from extreme loading.

# Cementless Options

Primary Surgery:

When used in a primary surgery, the Stryker femoral and Trident® metal shell components should be implanted in accordance with the applicable Surgical Protocols. However, if an uncemented metal shell is being implanted with the Trident® Constrained Acetabular Insert, supplemental fixation, with a minimum of two (2) bone screws, is recommended.

Revision Surgery:

When the Trident® Constrained Acetabular Insert is chosen for use in the revision of a Trident® Acetabular Component, the existing Trident® insert should be removed in accordance with the appropriate Stryker Surgical Protocol. Care should be taken not to mar the interior of the existing metal shell when removing the insert. The stability of the metal shell and the locking barbs must be assessed for any damage. Also, remove any tissue that may get wedged between the insert and shell lip.

Revising the Metal Shell:

If the shell requires replacement due to instability, bone loss, damage to the locking ring groove, or any other condition, the metal shell may be replaced with a Stryker Trident® shell in accordance with the appropriate Surgical Protocol. If an uncemented metal shell is being implanted with the Trident® Constrained Acetabular Insert, supplemental fixation, with a minimum of two (2) bone screws, is recommended.

Retaining the Metal Shell:

Once the integrity of the existing metal shell is established, remove any membranes from the screw holes and inside the shell. Also remove any tissue that may impinge the polyethylene liner engagement at the periphery of the metal shell.

Trial Evaluation:

The appropriate size Trident® Constrained Trial Insert is selected to evaluate joint mechanics. Refer to the trial table on page 6 for the appropriate size trial insert. The Trident® Constrained Trial Inserts contain a screw mechanism to secure the trial to the acetabular shell. The trial insert is inserted into the Trident® Acetabular Shell and the screw mechanism must be tightened by using the Stryker Torx Screw Drivers. Once the trial insert is fully seated, the trial
reduction can be performed. Once the
trial reduction is performed, remove
the trial insert.


Component Selection

Select the appropriate sized Trident® Constrained Acetabular Insert by correlating the insert letter designation (alpha code) with that of the shell that corresponds to the head size.

Component Selection

Select the appropriate sized Trident® Constrained Acetabular Insert by correlating the insert letter designation (alpha code) with that of the shell that corresponds to the head size.

Implantation
For proper seating and locking of the
constrained insert, the insert must be
both rotationally and axially aligned
to the acetabular shell prior to final
impaction. While holding the insert in
your fingers, rotationally align the insert
locking grooves to the barbs of the shell
making sure the location of the 10° lip
matches that of the trial insert.
Once the insert is rotationally aligned,
press the insert into the shell while
keeping the axis of the insert parallel
to the axis of the shell (Figure 2).
Push the insert into the shell until the
insert will not go any further. Care must
be taken not to rock, tilt, or misalign
the insert prior to final impaction, as
this may damage the polyethylene
locking bead thus preventing proper
seating and locking.
Locking of the Trident® Constrained
Acetabular Insert into the appropriately
sized Trident® metal shell is the same as
standard Trident®Acetabular Polyethylene
Inserts. The constrained insert, however,
cannot be impacted into the shell with
the Stryker Acetabular Cup Insert
Impactor (2101-0130).


Locking Insert into
Shell
Method One
Select the Constrained
LinerInserter/Impactor
Tip (2199-20XX or 2199-
20XX Rev. C or greater)
that corresponds to the
femoral head size (Figure 3).
If using the 2199-20XX
Impactor Tip – Thread
the tip onto the Trident®
Cup Positioner / Impactor
handle (2101-0200,
Figure 4A). If using the
2199-20XX Rev. C or
greater Impactor Tip –
Thread the metal adapter
onto the tip. Load the tip
into the Insert Positioner /
Impactor Handle (2111-
0000B, Figure 4B). Insert
the tip into the bipolar
(Figure 5). Impact the
insert to its final seating
with the rim of the
Impactor Tip flush with
the face of the insert.
Check for proper seating
by assuring that the
periphery of the insert is
in contact with the shell,
circumferentially.

Method Two

Use the Cutting Edge Femoral Head Impactor (1104-1000) to strike against the spherical surface of the inner bipolar metal shell. Alternatively, the Command Femoral Head Impactor (6266-0-140) may be used. Impact the insert to its final seating with the force and instrument perpendicular to the shell face. Check for proper seating by assuring that the periphery of the insert is in contact with the shell, circumferentially.


Method Three

Select a Threaded Trial Head (1205-0022 / 1205-0028 / 1205-0032) with the same outer diameter as the inner diameter of the chosen constrained insert. Also, select an appropriately sized Head Removal Key (HI-UHRK-3638 / HI-UHRK-28 / HI-UHRK-32).

WARNING: Ensure the Head Removal
Key is available to remove the
Threaded Trial Head before proceeding.

Assemble the Howmedica Osteonics
Threaded Trial Head onto the
Howmedica Osteonics Threaded
Impactor/Extractor Handle (2101-0004).
Once assembled, insert the Threaded
Trial Head into the bipolar component
of the constrained insert. Impact the
insert to its final seating with the force
and instrument perpendicular to the

shell face. Check for proper seating by
assuring that the periphery of the insert
is in contact with the shell,
circumferentially. Once the insert is
seated, remove the Threaded Trial Head /
Impactor / Extractor Handle assembly
from the constrained bearing insert
with the selected Head Removal Key.
Use of the Head Removal Key

# Femoral Bearing Head/Insert Assembly

After assembly of the constrained insert into the metal shell, the head of the implanted femoral stem is positioned on the opening of the constrained insert’s bipolar component. If utilizing a femoral stem with a modular femoral head, the modular femoral head must be fully seated onto the femoral stem trunnion prior to assembly with the Trident® Constrained Acetabular Insert (See Table 2 for head compatibility). The bipolar component’s opening must be fully visible before introducing the femoral bearing head into the component. 

Reduce the stem in the standard
fashion by elevating the patient’s leg
and applying a slight downward force
until the head snaps into the bipolar
component. The bipolar component
has a positive locking mechanism which
enables the bipolar and femoral head to
be assembled with less than five pounds
of force. The locking mechanism
consists of a split polyethylene ring
which is captured within the bipolar’s
polyethylene insert. As the femoral head
is inserted into the bipolar, the assembly
load forces the expansion of the split
ring within the bipolar. Upon clearing
the maximum diameter of the head, the ring contracts to its normal diameter,
resulting in the entrapment of the head
within the bipolar.


Once the joint is reduced, the femoral head is retained within the constrained insert and can be removed only through use of a Stryker UHR® Head Removal Key.

# Use of the Head Removal Key

Insert the Head Removal Key into the inner bearing area between the bipolar component and the Threaded Trial Head of the Impactor/Extractor and push upward toward the UHR® head center. This spreads the locking ring within the UHR® component. With a gentle pulling action, remove the Impactor/Extractor Handle assembly and the key from the constrained insert at the same time.


# Constrained Insert Removal

Removal of the constrained acetabular cup insert, if necessary, may be accomplished using a 3.3mm drill bit and a self-tapping bone screw with a 3.4mm or higher major thread diameter and a round bullet tip. Rotate the bipolar component within the cup insert to allow the drill access to the medial wall
of the insert. Using a 3.3mm drill bit,
create a hole slightly off-center of the
medial wall of the insert. Caution should
be taken to avoid drilling through the

dome hole of the metal shell. The deep-
ening of this hole should be stopped

before contact is made with the inner
surface of the metal shell.
The appropriately-sized bone screw
is started into the drill hole (a 35mm
screw length or longer is recommended).
Advance the screw until the tip contacts
the inner surface of the metal shell.
Continued advancement of the screw
levers the cup insert from its seated
position. Once the cup insert has been
lifted from its fully-seated position by
the bone screw, additional distractive
force may be applied with an elevator
or osteotome.



If access to the medial wall of the insert is unattainable, the titanium alloy retaining ring on the outer rim of the acetabular insert may be removed using an osteotome and/or forceps. Insert removal may proceed as indicated above, only in the area of the outer rim of the insert. The cup insert may also be removed by utilizing an osteotome, elevator and/or forceps at the cup insert/metal shell junction, to pry the insert from its locked position within the cup shell.

Option 1:
Cementing into an Implanted
Shell or Cage:
Following the fixation of a shell or cage
device, a Trident® All-Poly Constrained
Insert may be cemented into the device.
Trialing
To assess head center placement, a trial
reduction may be performed by using
the appropriate Trident® All-Poly
Constrained Trial Insert and head trial

to assess joint mechanics and appropri-
ate head center placement. Refer to the

trial table on page 6 for the appropriate
size trial insert. The Trident® All-Poly
Constrained Trial Inserts contain a
screw mechanism to secure the trial to
a shell or cage with compatible dome
hole threads. The screw mechanism
must be tightened using the Stryker
Torx Screwdrivers.
NOTE: The insert trials are the same
size as the actual implant, and do not
take into account a cement mantle.

Cementing and Inserting Implant
Once trial reduction is complete, the
insert can now be cemented in place
(see Table 3 on page 2).

Method One

If using the 2199-20XX Impactor
Tip – Thread the Constrained Liner
Inserter/ Impactor Tip onto the Trident®

Cup Impactor handle. Place the antever-
sion rod in the correct position.

If using the 2199-20XX Rev. C or
greater Impactor Tip – Thread the
metal adapter onto the tip. Load the tip
into the Insert Positioner / Impactor
Handle.
Mount the selected Trident® All-Poly
Constrained Insert on the inserter tip
(Figure 5 on page 3). Mix one pack of
Simplex bone cement according to the
manufacturer’s specifications and lavage

the inside of the cup shell. Dry thor-
oughly prior to the introduction of the

bone cement. The cement is mixed and
is inserted into the acetabular shell in
bolusform. Once it has achieved a doughy
state, the insert, mounted on the inserter
tip, is then pressed gently into the cup
and driven deeply into the bed of cement.
The angle guide allows assessment of
proper cup position, which is typically
40 to 45 degrees of abduction or lateral

opening and 10 to 20 degrees of antev-
ersion.

NOTE: When determining the proper
angulation of the insert, it is important to
critically evaluate the anatomic landmarks
and patient anatomy for optimum
placement.

It is essential that the insert be com-
pressed into the cup and the introducer

held as still as possible until cement has
hardened. After the cement is cured,
the insert introducer is then carefully
removed from the insert. Take special
measures to remove all excess bone
cement from the edges of the cup by
utilizing curettes and osteotomes.

Method Two

Select a Threaded Trial Head (1205-0022
/ 1205-0028 / 1205-0032) with the same
outer diameter as the inner diameter of
the chosen constrained insert. Also,
select an appropriately sized Head

Removal Key (HI-UHRK-3638 / HI-
UHRK-28 / HI-UHRK-32).

WARNING: Ensure the Head Removal
Key is available to remove the
Threaded Trial Head before proceeding.

## Page 10: Preparing the Acetabulum for Cementing and Trident® Constrained Acetabular Insert Trials

**Keywords:** acetabulum, cementing, reaming, Trident® Constrained Acetabular Insert Trials, drivers

Option 2: 
Cementing into the Acetabulum:
To cement the Trident® All-Poly
Constrained Insert directly into the
acetabulum, the bone must first be
properly prepared. This is done through
spherical acetabular reaming.

Reaming:
Acetabular reaming is initiated with
a reamer size that fits easily into the
socket. This allows reaming based on
the anatomic center of the acetabulum.
Initial reaming should be carried out
to identify the medial wall. Reaming
should medialize the socket to this
point but care should be taken not to
compromise or violate the medial wall.
NOTE: If too small a reamer is chosen
to begin with, the reaming process
may begin eccentrically, thus removing
excessive anterior or posterior wall bone
stock with resultant non-anatomic
placement of the acetabular component.
The low profile design of the Cutting
Edge Spherical Reamer necessitates the need to ream to the full depth. The
reamer head should be driven to the
point where the rim/cross bar contacts
the acetabular wall at the peripheral
lunate region. Removal of the reamer
from the handle is performed by pulling
back on the locking sleeve and rotating
the reamer head a quarter-turn in a
clockwise direction.
NOTE: Care should be taken not to
enlarge or distort the acetabulum by
eccentric reaming. Final acetabular
reaming ideally shows the hemispherical
acetabulum denuded of cartilage, with
the subchondral plate preferably intact,

and the anterior acetabular wall pre-
served.

It is believed that the subchondral plate
functions as an important load-sharing
and support mechanism. Preserving as
much of the subchondral plate as possible
may help preserve the qualities of the
bone/metal composite.
Reaming should be done to the desired
implantation size.
NOTE: It is recommended to have a
2mm cement mantle, so 4mm should
be added to the respective Trident®
Constrained Insert Outer Bearing OD
Spherical Diameter (see Table 3 on page
2) to equal the implantation size (i.e.,
if you ream to 56mm, add cement and
implant the insert with a 52mm OD).
NOTE: The Cutting Edge Spherical
Reamers are very aggressive and perform
best when sharp. Care should be taken
to protect the reamer from unnecessary
handling, as dull or damaged cutting
teeth may cause improper reaming. Dull
cutting teeth will resist hard bone and will deflect to cut softer bone. This situation may result in an irregularly shaped or enlarged acetabulum preparation.

Cement Fixation Holes:

After completion of reaming, fixation
holes may be made in the subchondral
plate. These can be made with a flexible
drill and drill guide provided in the
instrument set, a curette, or a power
bur. A single primary fixation hole
should be created in each of three areas:
the acetabular dome, ischial ramus, and
pubic ramus. Additional holes can be
created at the surgeon’s discretion.

**Keywords:** implant, cementing, inserting, Trident® All-Poly Constrained Insert, Simplex bone cement

Trialing
Trialing can be accomplished by using
the respective Insert Trial. The insert
trials are the same size as the actual
implant and do not take into account
the cement mantle. The trials should also be used to assess the fit and estimate final orientation of the cup prior to implantation.
NOTE: To maintain a 2mm cement
mantle, a trial 4mm greater than the
final implant may be used to assess
reaming depth. Take care to note the
associated head size of the larger trial.

Cementing and Inserting Implant:
Once trial reduction is complete, the
insert can now be cemented in place.

Method One:
If using the 2199-20XX Impactor Tip –
Thread the Constrained Liner Inserter/
Impactor Tip onto the Trident® Cup
Impactor handle. Place the anteversion
rod in the correct position.
If using the 2199-20XX Rev. C or

Description
The Trident® Constrained Acetabular
Insert is comprised of two pre-assembled
components: an outer insert component
and a captured UHR® (Universal Head)
component. The UHR® component is
comprised of an outer shell into which
a bearing insert has been permanently
assembled. The UHR® bearing insert
has a factory assembled UHMWPE
retention ring. The outer acetabular
insert has a Ti alloy retaining ring
which retains the UHR® head in the
plastic portion of the insert. With the
exception of the Trident® All-Poly
Constrained Inserts, the Trident®
Constrained Acetabular Inserts are
designed to be assembled with Trident®
metal acetabular shells. The Trident®
All-Poly Constrained Inserts can be
cemented directly into a GAP Cup, GAP
Ring, Trident® metal acetabular shell,
or directly into the acetabulum. The
assembled acetabular component
is used in conjunction with any
appropriately sized Howmedica
Osteonics stem of compatible head
size, to achieve total reconstructive
replacement of the hip joint.



Indications:
• The Trident® Constrained Acetabular
Insert is indicated for use as a
component of a total hip prosthesis in
primary and revision patients at high
risk of hip dislocation due to a history
of prior dislocation, bone loss, joint
or soft tissue laxity, neuromuscular
disease, or intraoperative instability.

Contraindications:
• Bone or musculature compromised
by disease, infection or prior
implantation, which cannot provide
adequate support or fixation for
the prosthesis.
• Infection in or about the hip joint.
• Skeletal immaturity.

Warnings and Precautions:
See package insert for warnings,
precautions, adverse effects and other
essential product information.
