**Keywords:** Femoral Preparation, Distal Resection, Triathlon Total Knee Arthroplasty, Intramedullary Alignment, Universal Driver

# Femoral Preparation
## Step 1 Distal Resection


### Exposure

▶ Triathlon Total Knee Arthroplasty can be performed through any standard approach. A standard anterior mid-line incision or other suitable approaches such as mid-vastus, sub-vastus or quadriceps sparing may be used based on surgeon preference.

▶ Any previous incision can be used or incorporated to decrease the risk of skin slough.

▶ The capsule is entered through a medial parapatellar approach.


### Femoral Intramedullary (IM) Alignment

▶ The Universal Driver allows for attachment of all drills and pins. It may be attached directly to a reamer, drill, or a Jacob's chuck.

▶ Locate the IM drill hole. It is approximately 1cm anterior to the femoral attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament and slightly medial to the mid-line of the distal femur.

▶ Attach the 3/8" IM Drill to the Universal Driver and drill into the IM canal. The first diameter will create a tight fit around the IM Rod. If further clearance is desired, continue to drill until the larger step diameter opens the hole.


▶ Attach the T-Handle Driver to the 5/16" IM Rod.

▶ Insert the IM Rod into the Femoral Alignment Guide as far proximal as possible. The Femoral Alignment Guide is designed for use on either the left or right knee and may be set to 5°, 6° or 7° of valgus.

▶ Set the instrument to the desired angle by pulling back on the black knob of the Femoral Alignment Guide and placing it in the appropriate notch.

▶ Advance the rod, with attached guide, slowly up the IM canal until the desired depth is reached.

#Step 1 (Continued)

> Snap the Universal Resection Guide onto the Adjustment Block and insert the posts of the Adjustment Block into the two holes in the Femoral Alignment Guide.

> Place the Femoral Alignment Guide in contact with the more prominent distal femoral condyle and align the guide in neutral position.

Tip: Align the Femoral Alignment Guide to the trans-epicondylar axis. The guide should usually have contact with both medial and lateral trochlea for more stability.

> Impact the distal captured pins in the Femoral Alignment Guide to aid in stabilization.

Note: Impacting a distal capture pin that does not make contact with the femoral condyle may result in an undesirable change in the alignment guide position.

> Pin the Distal Resection Guide to the anterior femur.

## Step 1 Distal Resection (continued)

> The Adjustment Block allows for an 8mm (the distal thickness of the femoral component) and 10mm (used to aid in the correction of a flexion contracture) resection level.

> Tip: The thickness of the resected femoral condyle should be measured. In some cases, a greater resection may be required. This can be accomplished by adjusting the block as described below to achieve a greater resection (+ 2mm or + 4mm).

> Press the black button on the end of the Adjustment Block and pull to set the resection to the desired level.

> Pin the Universal Resection Guide to the anterior femur.

> Note: If the medial "O" pin hole is too close to the edge of the bone (on smaller femurs), use the holes marked "2" which are closer to the center of the bone. Please note: this will limit the amount of further resection to 2mm.

**Keywords:** Femoral Preparation, Femoral Sizing, Femoral Sizer, Femoral Stylus, Whiteside's Line, EPI Line Indicator



# Femoral Preparation
## Step 2 Femoral Sizing


> Assemble the Femoral Sizer with the Femoral Stylus in the lateral hole (for both a left or right knee) and set the stylus length to an approximate size.

> Set the rotation to LEFT for a left knee and RIGHT for a right knee and adjust to the desired amount of external rotation.

> The Femoral Sizer also sets the final rotation of the femoral component. Additional checks for rotation may be made by lining up the epicondyles with the reference lines marked "EPI" or assessing Whiteside's line with a pin through the hole in the top of the guide.

Note: In the event of a hypoplastic femoral condyle: Pin the Femoral Sizer through the EPI hole on the unaffected side for stability. Rotate the Femoral Sizer and assess rotation using the rotational checks mentioned above.


> Position the assembly flush on the resected distal femur, sliding the feet of the Femoral Sizer under the posterior condyles. The Femoral Stylus point should be placed at the anticipated level of resection, commonly the lateral cortex.

> It is important that the Femoral Stylus point rest on bone and not on soft tissue.

> The size is determined by the position of the scribe mark on the Femoral Stylus shaft within the sizing window.

## Step 2 (continued)

► It is recommended that the anterior resection level be checked to further confirm the correct size by sliding a Bladerunner through the sizing guide's size-specific anterior slots and assessing the resection. If it appears that there is a potential for notching, the next larger size component will need to be chosen. Ensure the femoral component chosen is compatible with the size of the tibial component selected during tibial preparation.

► Once size confirmation is complete, attach the 1/8˝ Peg Drill to the Universal Driver and create fixation pin-holes (for the 4:1 Cutting Block) through the holes on the face of the Femoral Sizer marked "EPI".

## Step 3 Anterior, Posterior and Chamfer Cuts

### 4:1 Cutting Block Fixation

> Locate the fixation pegs of the appropriate size Express 4:1 Cutting Block into the pin holes created on the distal femur.

Note: Check run-out of the anterior cut. If not enough anterior bone is resected, consider selecting the next smaller size 4:1 Cutting Block. Ideally, the cut should be flush with the distal femur.

> Pin the 4:1 Cutting Block in place for stability.


### Femoral Anterior, Posterior and Chamfer Cuts

> Complete the remaining four femoral bone resections.

> The use of a .050" (1.25mm) thick sawblade is recommended.

> The order of bone resections is not critical; however, a recommended sequence for improved stability of the 4:1 Cutting Block is:
1. Anterior cortex.
2. Posterior condyles.
3. Posterior chamfer.
4. Anterior chamfer.


Note:
* Cutting the anterior chamfer last helps stabilize the cutting guide.
* It is advisable to pay close attention to minimizing the bias on the sawblade during these resections.

> Remove the 4:1 Cutting Block.

# Femoral Preparation
## Step 4 PS Box Preparation

### PS Box Preparation

► If it is determined that a PS femoral component will be used, the distal femur must be prepared for the PS box. Place the appropriate sized PS Box Cutting Guide on the resected distal femur.

> Note: The appropriate size is the same as the size 4-in-1 cutting block that was used to prepare the distal femur. For example, if a size 3 "4-in-1 Cutting Block" was used to prepare the distal femur, select the size 3 PS Box Cutting Guide.

► M/L placement of the guide is based primarily on best coverage of the distal bone and alignment of the box opening with the intercondylar notch.

**Optional surgical tip:** Use a CR Femoral Trial of the same size to identify the preferred M/L position of the PS Box Cutting Guide.

- Place the appropriate sized CR Femoral Trial on to the prepared femur.
- Adjust the M/L placement of the Femoral Trial to achieve the desired position of the femoral component.
- Using a surgical marketing pen, mark the location of the distal peg prep holes through the CR Femoral Trial.
- Remove the CR Femoral Trial and line-up the PS Box Cutting Guide on the distal femur with the previously marked holes.

### PS Box Cutting Guide

▶ Pin the PS Box Cutting Guide in place using Headless Pins.

▶ Optional surgical tip: To provide the appropriate anterior/posterior and medial/lateral stability with a minimal number of pins, place one pin distally and one pin anteriorly.


There are two ways to continue the PS box preparation:

### PS Box Preparation Option: Chisel and Saw

▶ Option A: Chisel and Saw: Cut the cortical rim on both sides of the posterior-most portion of the intercondylar notch using the oscillating saw.

• Assemble the Box Chisel and insert into the slot.

• Impact the Box Chisel with a mallet until seated to the stop. Leave the Box Chisel in place to act as a reference plane. Cut the medial and lateral edges of the box with an oscillating saw to complete the bone resection as shown.

• Avoid biasing the blade during resection for optimal bone conservation.

# Tibial Preparation
## Step 1A Tibial Preparation: Extramedullary (EM) Referencing


### Tibial Resection Assembly

▶ The Tibial Resection Guide, available in left and right configurations, and the Universal Resection Guide are designed to avoid soft tissue impingement.

▶ The tibial resection assembly has five parts: the appropriate Tibial Resection Guide, the Ankle Clamp, the Distal Assembly, the Tibial Alignment Proximal Rod and the Tibial Adjustment Housing. These are assembled first.

> Note: The Tibial Adjustment Housing is available in 3° slope and 0° slope (optional).

### Tibial Slope

▶ Place the ankle clamp around the ankle and unlock the locking switch.

▶ Tibial slope can be checked by verifying that the long axis of the assembly is parallel to the tibia.

> Caution:
> - The center of the ankle is generally in line with the second metatarsal, unless ankle and foot deformity is present. The assembly should be aligned over the center of the ankle.
> - Because of the shape of the tibia, the distal portion of the guide will be further away from the tibia than the proximal. Failure to recognize this will result in placing the component in extension.

### Varus/Valgus Alignment

▶ Medial/Lateral offset can be adjusted by pushing the bronze button (1) and sliding the assembly medially until the shaft intersects the center of the tibia.

▶ Once triaxial alignment is achieved, release the bronze button.

### Tibial Slope Adjustment

▶ If the Proximal Rod is parallel to the tibia, the slope is 0° or 3° depending on which Tibial Adjustment Housing is used.

▶ Tibial slope can be adjusted by pressing the bronze button (2).

## Step 1B: Tibial Preparation: Intramedullary (IM) Referencing


▶ Attach the 3/8" IM Drill to the Universal Driver and create a hole in the location determined by the pre-operative X-rays to align with the IM canal.


▶ Attach the T-Handle Driver to the 5/16" IM Rod and slowly pass into the canal, ensuring clearance. Remove the 5/16" IM Rod and insert it into the body of the Tibial Alignment Jig IM. The assembly is then inserted into the canal beyond the isthmus to the physeal scar of the ankle if possible.


### Rotational Alignment

▶ With the body of the Tibial Alignment Jig IM resting on the proximal tibia, proper rotational alignment is achieved by rotating the instrument about the 5/16" IM Rod so that the vertical mounting bar is at the junction of the medial and middle 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle. A Headless Pin or the 1/8" Drill is then inserted into the fixation hole to fix rotation (See Inset).

# Tibial Preparation
## Step 2 Tibial Resection

The following applies to both extramedullary and intramedullary alignment.

### Establish Tibial Resection Level

▶ The Tibial Stylus attaches to the Tibial Resection Guide or Universal Resection Guide with the "9" end referencing the lowest level of the unaffected compartment.

▶ 9mm of bone will be resected. Alternatively, if the "2" end of the Tibial Stylus is used, the amount of bone resected will be 2mm below the tip of the stylus.

▶ The height of the Tibial Resection Guide, Tibial Stylus and Tibial Adjustment Housing can be adjusted using the bronze wheel on the Tibial Adjustment Housing.

▶ For coarse adjustment, press the bronze wheel and slide the assembly up or down. For fine adjustment, turn the bronze wheel to the right to move the assembly up the Proximal Rod or turn left to move the assembly down the Proximal Rod.

▶ Pin the Tibial Resection Guide in place.

▶ Remove all alignment instruments leaving only the Tibial Resection Guide in place.

> **Note:** Rotate bronze wheel one extra turn to ensure stylus is under tension for accurate resection.


### Tibial Resection

▶ Resect the proximal tibia. An optional Tibial Resection Guide Modular Capture (Left or Right) may be added.

**Tip:**
* Prior to removing the Tibial Resection Guide, check for flatness with a straight edge of an instrument such as the Bladerunner.
* Use saline irrigation during resection.

# Tibial Preparation
## Step 2 Tibial Resection (continued)

There are two options to secure the Universal Tibial Template to the tibia:

### Securing Tibial Template

#### Option 1:

> Once satisfactory alignment and tibial component orientation are achieved, place pins through the two anterior holes of the Universal Tibial Template to secure its position. Remove the PS or CR Femoral Trial. Remove the Tibial Trial Insert and further secure the Universal Tibial Template by placing additional pins into the proximal tibia through any of the available holes.

#### Option 2:

> Once satisfactory alignment and tibial component orientation are achieved, mark the anterior tibial cortex in line with the reference marks on the anterior border of the Universal Tibial Template. Remove the PS or CR Femoral Trial and disassemble the Tibial Trial Insert from the Universal Tibial Template.

> Check the orientation and coverage of the Universal Tibial Template on the proximal tibia again while referencing the marks on the anterior border of the Universal Tibial Template and the anterior cortex made previously. Reposition the Universal Tibial Template if required while maintaining a flush fit to the anterior tibial cortex.

> Place pins through the two anterior holes of the Universal Tibial Template to secure its position. Further secure the Universal Tibial Template by placing additional pins into the proximal tibia through any of the available holes.

**Tip:** In dense bone, holes for pinning, may be pre-drilled using the 1/8" drill (3170-0000).

**Note:** The Tibial Insert Trial can be removed by hand or with the aid of a retractor.

## Page 34: Patella Preparation

**Keywords:** Patella Preparation, Patella Resection, Patella Peg Preparation, Drill Selection Guide, Tritanium Metal-Backed Patella

# Patella Preparation

## Patella Resection

> Patella preparation is optional and is based on surgeon preference and surgeon evaluation of the articulating surface.

> Remove all osteophytes and synovial insertions around the patella, and measure thickness using a caliper.

> After determining the depth of the cut, affix the stylus in the appropriate slot of the Patella Resection Guide and capture the patella between the jaws of the guide.

Note: Care should be taken when determining the depth of the cut in an effort to minimize the risk of fracture. The amount of bone to be left after resecting the patella is a clinical decision and is based on surgeon judgment and evaluation of patient characteristics.

> Using a .050" (1.25mm) non-offset sawblade, resect the patella.


## Patella Peg Preparation

> Choose the appropriate size Patella Drill Template and insert into the Patella Clamp.

> Position the chosen patellar drill guide over the patella and secure it to the bone by deploying the clamp mechanism.

### Drill Selection Guide

> For Tritanium Metal-Backed Patella*: Use the standard Metal-Backed Patella drill (6541-3-522); 5.7mm (0.225in) drill diameter = 0.4mm (0.016in) pressfit.

> If the bone is sclerotic in any of the peg locations, the Surgeon may elect to use the Tritanium Dense Bone Patella Drill (6541-3-526), which will create slightly less press fit; 6.0mm (0.235in) drill diameter = 0.15mm (0.006in) pressfit.

> If the surgeon chooses to cement the Tritanium Metal-Backed Patella or prefers to use a cemented All Poly-Patella, then the All-Poly Patella Drill (6541-3-524) must be used.

> Drill three fixation holes with the appropriate drill.
