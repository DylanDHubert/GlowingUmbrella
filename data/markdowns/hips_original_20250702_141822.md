# Introduction

This surgical protocol is a guide to preparing the femur for an Insignia Hip Stem. The total system includes 12 body sizes ranging from size 0 to size 11.

Insignia is a broach only, fully HA coated stem designed for muscle-sparing surgical approaches in addition to traditional approaches. Designed using Stryker's proprietary SOMA database, it features a size specific collar and size specific medial curvature.

The stem is designed for use with Stryker V40 femoral heads, sleeves and their compatible acetabular components.

## Preoperative planning

### Step 1

Pre-operative planning aids in the determination of probable implant style and size. The pre-operative planning process should take qualitative and quantitative factors (including patient bone quality, density, and morphology) into consideration in order to evaluate and select the appropriate implant system for the patient. Digital templates are available for use.

### Determining leg length

With the templates provided, determine the desired postoperative leg length, taking into consideration radiographic leg length inequality and patient clinical assessment.

For example, if 8mm of leg lengthening is required to equalize the leg lengths, make a new mark 8mm superior to the center of rotation marked during templating of the acetabular shell. This new mark will be your target when templating the femoral stem (described below).

In this example, if this plan is properly executed at the time of surgery, there will be 8mm of leg lengthening.

Similarly, the predicted change in offset is also considered by comparing the relative medial/ lateral position of the center of rotation marking of the acetabular component and new mark used to plan the femoral component. The digital templates should be used to estimate the final components that most closely restore the normal offset of the patient's hip.

### Tips:

- Templating is an important aspect of pre-operative planning, but it should only serve as a guide. Final decision making concerning fit, size, and soft tissue tensioning should take place intra-operatively at the surgeon's discretion.
- The templated stem size and neck resection level may have to be adjusted if leg length cannot be managed solely by changing the head offset.
- Patient positioning is key to obtaining adequate hip stability and acetabular placement.
- Standing pre-operative x-rays are recommended. Both an A/P and lateral x-ray are preferred to assess stem size.
- To help facilitate correct placement of final implants, take into account any pelvic tilt observed.

### Acetabular cup position and sizing

Utilize the acetabular templates to determine the optimal position and size for the acetabular component. Be sure the cup is well centered in the acetabulum and the size fills between the tear drop and the superior rim (Figure 1). After templating, mark the center of rotation.

### Femoral stem selection

Insignia has two offset options for each size: Standard and High Offset. Refer to page 15 for more information on sizing options. High Offset is designed to provide 5mm of direct lateralization, increasing offset without changing leg length.

Choose the template for which the stem size achieves medio-lateral cortical engagement at the proximal two-thirds of the stem and recreates the desired leg length and offset. For both Standard and High Offset options, the template has markings that indicate the center of the femoral head for a range of head offset options.

Through templating and trialing, determine which option restores proper offset and center of rotation by matching the cup's center of rotation with the desired head center of rotation of either the Standard or High Offset stem.

Once the final estimated stem size and position is determined, the neck resection level should be noted. This will be used as a reference during intra-operative neck resection.

## Femoral neck resection

### Step 2

A proper neck resection level directly affects the final placement and fit of the femoral stem. A neck resection is made with an oscillating saw and with the aid of the Neck Resection Guide (1020-1100).

The guide helps the surgeon to determine the correct stem placement. The guide is placed on the anterior/posterior aspect of the exposed proximal femur and the planned femoral neck cut is marked using a marking instrument of choice (Figure 2). Care should be taken to align the body of the guide with the axis of the femoral canal.

**Tip:** The neck resection should be about 1-2mm above the planned broach seating height. This will allow for calcar planing prior to final implant placement enhancing collar contact with medial bone.

**Note:** To achieve collar contact with the calcar, the calcar should be reamed to the level of the final broach.

## Preparing the femoral canal

### Step 3

To help facilitate desired final stem orientation, accessing the canal laterally and posteriorly is ideal. Make sure to retract/protect abductors.

Often, removal of the cortical bone of the inner table of the greater trochanter at the piriformis insertion is required. The Reverse Cutting Rasp (1440-2003), Modular Box Osteotome (1601-1210) or a rongeur can be used to remove bone from this area and establish version (Figure 3). The Rasp operates in one direction and cuts as it is pulled out of the femur.

#### Tips:

- Remove the lateral cortical bone at the piriformis fossa to help obtain ideal proximal fit and to minimize the risk of undersizing and/or varus placement of the femoral component.
- The Axial Starter Reamer (1020-1200) may be used with the T-Handle (1101-2200) or power to open the femoral canal and to aid in determining the orientation of the femoral axis.

**Note:** Care should be taken not to sink the Axial Starter Reamer below the first graduation mark to allow for proper press fit of the implant.

## Broaching
### Step 4

Insignia is designed to be compatible with several broach handle designs to ease insertion in various surgical approaches.

Broaching is performed beginning with the size 0 broach. The broach should be inserted via canal access by positioning the broach laterally and posteriorly. Insignia was designed to be inserted parallel to the posterior cortical bone of the femoral neck although adjustments can be made by the surgeon during insertion based on patient need.

Sequentially broach upward in size until the proper fit is achieved. The surgeon's clues to a firm fit and final size include 1.) increased resistance to forward advancement; 2.) changing pitch of sound that results from mallet blows to the broach handle; 3.) lack of further motion, and 4.) rotational stability as assessed with broach handle in place.

Upon reaching the final size and depth of the broach, detach the broach handle from the broach, leaving the broach fully seated in the femoral canal (Figure 4, Figure 5).

### Tips:
- The neck resection should be about 1-2 mm above the final broach height. This will allow for calcar planing prior to final implant placement enhancing collar contact with medial bone.
- Relying only on the neck resection height alone for final seating height may lead to improper sizing and inadequate component fixation.
- For good fixation of the implant, it is important to maintain rotational alignment throughout the broaching process.
- For broach handles featuring a lever design, close the lever arm until the broach is secured onto the Broach Handle.
- For broach handles featuring a lever design, to open the lever with one hand place your thumb on the top edge of the impaction pad and your index finger in the notch under the end of the lever. Use your index finger to pull up on the lever.

### Broach handle styles Insignia is compatible with:
1. Extra Offset Broach Handle – Lever
(7000-5529)
2. Straight Broach Handle – Lever
(7000-5525)
3. Offset Broach Handle – Lever
(7000-5526)
4. Straight Broach Handle
(1440-1460)
5. Offset Broach Handle
(1020-1460)
6. Dual Offset Broach Handle
(Left: 1440-2000; Right: 1440-2001)

### Note: 
Insignia broaches can be properly identified through the following:

1) The size is marked on the top of the broach post.
2) The size is marked in the tab slot.
3) 8000-77xx part number.

## Trial reduction

### Step 5

Select a Neck Trial that corresponds to the color shown on top of the final broach and matches the planned Standard or High Offset implant size (Figure 6). The High Offset option is designed to provide 5mm of direct offset without changing leg length.

The table below indicates the correct neck trial color code for each stem size. The High Offset neck trials feature a gold TiN coating (Figure 7).

Assemble the Neck Trial onto the broach. Next, assemble a V40 Head Trial onto the Neck Trial. Femoral heads come in multiple options and are different for each femoral head implant material (see table below). For this reason, final head material should be chosen prior to trial reduction. Offsets add or subtract from the base neck length of the implant and help to achieve the desired leg length and offset.

Perform a trial reduction of the hip. The final broach size facilitates determination of the correct implant size. Upon confirmation of the selected components, note selected neck offset, femoral head, and broach size.

## Tips:

* Neck trials are collarless, designed to allow trialing of the construct prior to calcar planning. Trialing should be done prior to planing the calcar to allow for stem size adjustments.
* During the trial reduction, an x-ray may be used to verify proper broach size and position, leg length and offset.
* After trialing, check broach rotational stability again.

## Calcar preparation

### Step 6

Assemble the Calcar Planer to the reamer power adaptor.

With the final broach in place, guide the Calcar Planer over the broach post ensuring the Calcar Planer is axially aligned with the post and is stable. Initiate power prior to contacting the femur and slowly advance the Calcar Planer toward the broach using continuous power until the positive stop on the Calcar Planer contacts the broach face and the bone is removed (Figure 8). Failure to operate the Calcar Planer in accordance with these instructions may result in damage to the femur.

In the event that the Calcar Planer cannot fully engage the broach post, remove the broach and perform a new neck resection at a lower level. Alternatively, a larger broach size could also be considered.

Upon confirmation of the selected components, reassemble the broach handle to the broach. Remove the broach from the femoral canal.

**Note:** Two sizes of Calcar Planers are available, Calcar Planer – Standard (1020-1111) and Calcar Planer – Large (1020-1112).

**Note:** Calcar planing is required to facilitate preparation of stem collar.

## Implanting the stem

### Step 7

Prior to any impaction using a mallet, the implant should be inserted into the femoral canal by hand until it meets resistance. This aids in positioning the implant in the same orientation that was broached, preventing the stem from being forced into a different position.

Several stem inserters are available to help facilitate various surgical approaches.

#### Option 1 – Modular Offset Quick Connect Stem Inserter (1020-1860)

Insignia can be inserted using the Modular Offset Quick Connect Stem Inserter. Place tip of the inserter into the drive hole of the stem taking care to align the version tab on the inserter with the slot in the stem (Figure 9). The quick connect design provides the inserter with a stable spring connection, providing rotational control during stem implantation, but it does not provide a mechanical lock. Therefore, this assembly should be handled with care, as excessive shaking or motion may result in the stem disassociating from the inserter.

**Note:** For Size 0 and Size 1 Insignia stems, use the Modular Stem Impactor or Modular Threaded Stem Inserter. The Modular Offset Quick Connect Stem Inserter cannot be used. Misuse could lead to instrument failure.

#### Option 2 – Modular Stem Impactor (1020-1870)

The Modular Stem Impactor has a spherical tip, which is placed onto the drive hole of the stem. This instrument allows for off-axis impaction of the stem, if needed. The Modular Stem Impactor does not connect to the stem, and, therefore, can only be used for final impaction of the stem.

#### Option 3 – Modular Threaded Stem Inserter (1020-1800)

If using the Modular Threaded Stem Inserter, thread the Modular Threaded Stem Inserter into the drive hole on the proximal face of the stem. The inserter should be fully threaded and secured to the stem prior to impaction to help prevent damage to the threads on the implant or the instrument. This inserter is designed to provide rotational control during stem implantation. The inserter is designed to provide rotational control during stem implantation.

**Keywords:** Insignia Hip Stem, surgical protocol, Orthonomic Modular Handle, Mallet, Modular Threaded Stem Inserter

## Step 7 (Continued)
A mallet is then used to gently seat the stem into the canal, following the central axis of the femur, ideally when the collar is just above or rests on the calcar (Figure 10). If the collar is sitting proud, do not attempt to continue impacting the stem if visual and auditory clues indicate that it is firmly seated in the canal. These clues, rather than the collar seating level, should be used to determine the final seating height of the implant. Continued aggressive impaction could lead to femoral fracture.

In the event that dense bone is encountered intra-operatively and compounding anatomical factors are present, the seating of the implant may not be consistent with the level of the broach due to the viscoelastic nature of the femoral bone.* If the final seating height is undesirable, the implant can be removed and additional broaching can be performed.

**Tip:** Use moderate mallet strikes/blows to seat the stem until it is stable.

If the stem hangs up due to impingement of the Modular Threaded Stem Inserter against the overhanging tip of the greater trochanter, remove the threaded stem inserter leaving the stem in place and use the Modular Stem Impactor to fully seat the stem.

**Warning:**
- If any intra-operative stem extraction is required, utilize the Modular Threaded Stem Inserter (1020-1800).
- If the stem inserter is contacting the greater trochanter during insertion, continued impaction could lead to a fracture.

## Final reduction

### Step 8

Prior to final head assembly, femoral head selection may be re-evaluated using a V40 Head Trial. Place the Head Trial onto the stem neck taper and reduce the hip.

Leg length equality and proper soft tissue tension are evaluated. Remove the Head Trial and dry the implant trunnion with a sponge or sterile towel.

Select the appropriate corresponding V40 Femoral Head (BIOLOX delta Ceramic, CoCr, Alumina Ceramic) or sleeve and place it onto the dry trunnion of the femoral stem with a slight twist. Impact the head with two moderate impactions using the Modular Head Impactor (1601-1700) (Figure 11).

Verify the head is secure on the trunnion after head impaction by applying traction to the head and confirming stability on the trunnion. If necessary, the head can be removed utilizing a head disassembly instrument (6059-9-505).*

Relocate the femoral head into the acetabular cup and re-check the hip biomechanics. The surgical site is then closed according to surgeon preference.

*If a ceramic head is placed on the trunnion and then removed, it must be replaced with a V40 cobalt chrome head or a V40 Titanium Adapter Sleeve (17-0000E) and a C-Taper ceramic head.

If the stem must be removed, utilize the Modular Threaded Stem Inserter (1020-1800).

### Warning:

- Following trial reduction and prior to final head assembly, clean and dry the implant to ensure the taper is free of debris. Finally, clean the bearing surfaces and reduce the hip.
- Any debris that is potentially generated must be fully lavaged prior to wound closure.

After completing the trialing process, intra-operatively assemble the adaptor sleeve to the femoral stem manually. The Universal Adaptor Sleeve must be fully seated on the stem taper before the head is assembled.

**Note:** In no instance should any attempt be made to pre-assemble the adaptor sleeve inside the BIOLOX delta Universal Ceramic Head.
Intra-operatively assemble the BIOLOX delta Universal Taper Ceramic Head onto the sleeved femoral stem and set with two moderate strikes using the Stem Head Impactor (1104-1000). Care must be taken to avoid excessive impact forces when assembling the Ceramic Head to the sleeved femoral component.


### Optional:

When selecting a BIOLOX delta Universal Taper Ceramic Femoral Head (6519-1-0XX) for implantation, use of a Universal Adaptor Sleeve (below) is necessary.

Catalog no: 6519-T-025, offset(mm): -2.5, Taper: V40
Catalog no:  6519-T-100, offset(mm): +0, Taper: V40
Catalog no: 6519-T-204 , offset (mm) +4, Taper: V40
