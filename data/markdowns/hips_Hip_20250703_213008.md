## Step 1

### Preoperative planning and X-ray evaluation

Preoperative planning is an essential part of the procedure, and templating should be performed prior to every case. The preoperative planning process should take qualitative and quantitative factors (including patient bone quality, density and morphology) into consideration in order to evaluate and select the appropriate instrument/implant system for the patient. X-ray evaluation may also help detect anatomic anomalies that could prevent the intraoperative achievement of the established preoperative goals. Selecting potential implant style and sizes can facilitate operating room preparation and assure availability of an appropriate selection. When it is done using X-rays that have been suitably scaled for magnification, templating allows the surgeon to predict the style, size and position of the implant that may help restore the correct anatomy of the individual patient.

Template planning can be done using acetate templates for printed X-rays or preoperative planning software for digital studies.

Use the template overlay LTEM116 available through your Stryker representative.

## Step 2

### Acetabular preparation

The acetabulum is prepared using the surgeon's preferred technique to gain adequate exposure for reaming. Excision of the labrum and osteophytes allows for proper visualization of the bony anatomy and improves ease of reaming.

Stryker's femoral and wing retractors can be utilized to help gain acetabular exposure. (Figure 1)

With the acetabulum exposed, bony defects can be identified. If necessary, bone grafting options may be considered prior to reaming.

### Note

Careful identification and removal of osteophytes can help reduce the possibility of bone-to-bone or component-to-bone impingement.

**Keywords:** Trident II Clusterhole HA, surgical protocol, reaming process, CuttingEdge Reamers, acetabular shells

### Step 3

#### Reaming

Handles are available in straight and offset configurations to connect to CuttingEdge Reamers (Figures 2a, 2b, 3). It is recommended to begin reaming at least 4mm smaller than the template size after removing medial osteophyte. Progressive reaming should proceed in 1mm to 2mm increments until the final size is achieved.

The Trident II Clusterhole HA shell diameter is oversized by approximately 0.8mm of the labeled size (e.g., 52mm= 52.8mm). The surgeon should consider the acetabular bone quality and assess bone stock, amount of interference fit, and desired amount of reaming when preparing the interference fit. It is recommended to ream line-to-line with the labeled shell size, however the surgeon may choose to under-ream by 1mm based on his/her assessment of the bone quality. Start rotating the reamer prior to engaging bone to reduce initial torque upon contact.

The profile of the reamer necessitates reaming to the full depth. The reamer should be driven to the point where the rim contacts the acetabular wall at the peripheral lunate region. If bone stock allows, reaming should optimize bone contact against both the posterior and anterior walls.

Care should be taken to prevent enlarging or distorting the prepared cavity by eccentric reaming. Ideally, final reaming provides mechanical support for the acetabular shell directly on viable host bone.

Many surgeons prefer to target a zone of 40¬±10¬∞ of inclination and 15¬±10¬∞ of anteversion depending on patient anatomy and biomechanics.

#### Notes

- Changes in pelvic tilt and pelvic flexion caused by patient positioning on the table, as well as disease in the contralateral hip, spine and pelvis, may impact a surgeon's ability to attain the desired component placement from preoperative planning.

- The amount of interference fit should be determined intraoperatively based upon the patient's bone quality and acetabular size. When osteoporotic bone is encountered, it is recommended to under-ream by 1mm of the labeled shell size. When sclerotic bone is encountered, it may be difficult to fully seat the shell. In this situation, it is recommended to ream line-to-line to reduce the potential for problems that may typically occur in dense bone.

- Potential challenges when implanting acetabular shells may include: acetabular fracture, incomplete seating of the implant in the prepared cavity or slight deformation of the titanium shell, making the insert more difficult to seat.

- Following reaming, the surgeon should ensure that soft tissues are clear and osteophytes are removed from the prepared site.

- The reamers perform best when sharp. Care should be taken to protect the reamer from unnecessary handling, as dull or damaged cutting teeth may cause improper reaming. Dull cutting teeth may deflect to cut softer bone and resist hard bone. This situation may result in an irregularly shaped or enlarged acetabular preparation.

**Keywords:** Trident II Clusterhole HA, surgical protocol, Window Trial, acetabular reamer, Shell Impactor

## Step 4

### Window Trial evaluation

Select a Window Trial of equal diameter or 1mm smaller than the last acetabular reamer used. Attach the Window Trial onto the Shell Impactor to evaluate the fit within the reamed acetabulum (Figure 6). The trial is windowed for visualization and assessment of depth, position, bone contact and congruency within the acetabulum. Impact gently into the acetabulum to avoid damage to the surrounding bone or press-fit.



### Instructions

#### Window Trial
To attach, insert the tip of the impactor flush with the square recess in the dome of the trial. Turn the knob clock-wise until the trial is attached. For the straight impactor, it may be required to apply light pressure on the knob in the direction of the trial to initially engage the threads.

Failure to completely thread the components together may result in damage to the threads upon impaction and lead to difficulty in detaching the components. Do not overtighten.

> It is recommended to use a Window Trial that is line-to-line or 1mm smaller than the last reamer.

### Step 5

#### Shell implantation

Assess the acetabular bone and surrounding soft tissue to ensure shell insertion will not be inhibited. Prior to implantation, it is prudent to reassess patient positioning in the surgical field and adjust to the correct position if necessary.

Select the appropriately sized Trident II Clusterhole HA Shell as identified on the product label. Attach the shell to the impactor using the instructions in the table.

An Alignment Guide can be attached to the Shell Impactor to aid in establishing abduction/inclination and anteversion angles (Figure 9). Many surgeons prefer to target a zone of 40¬±10Àö of abduction and 15¬±10Àö of anteversion depending on patient anatomy and biomechanics. The shell abduction angle of approximately 45¬∞ can be determined by positioning the Alignment Guide perpendicular to the long axis of the patient (Figure 10). Shell anteversion can be set at approximately 20¬∞ by moving the Shell Impactor so that the left/right anteversion rod is parallel to the long axis of the patient (Figure 11).

The screw hole pattern in the shell is intended to be oriented superiorly for ancillary screw fixation. During shell insertion, avoid damage to the roughened surface from instruments such as retractors, and avoid dragging across soft tissue to keep the shell free of debris.

Impact the shell into the acetabulum using a mallet until a stable press-fit is achieved. Remove the impactor by carefully unthreading from the shell. The shell seating depth may be determined by viewing the acetabulum through the exposed dome hole. Should further seating be required, the impactor can be reattached to the shell to facilitate secondary impaction.

An optional Hex Dome Hole Plug may only be inserted into the shell using the Trident II Straight Driver (7005-0099) or optional U-Joint Driver (7005-0100). Only these two drivers have a captive tip design to hold the Dome Hole Plug on, however excessive shaking or motion may cause the plug to detach. Evaluate the plug after insertion to confirm it is fully threaded into the shell to prevent impingement with the liner.

#### Instrument instructions

##### Shell impactors
Insert the impactor tip flush with the square recess in the shell dome (Figure 7). Turn the knob clockwise while applying a slight pressure towards the shell until it is attached. For the Straight Shell Impactor, it may be required to apply light pressure on the knob in the direction of the shell to initially engage the threads.

Failure to completely thread the components together may result in damage to the threads upon impaction. Do not overtighten. The gap on the knob is designed to indicate an inadequate connection and will be concealed after appropriate tightening (Figure 8).



##### Alignment Guides

Lateral 1440-1370
or
Supine 1440-1380

To attach, slide the Alignment Guide onto the flats of the impactor spindle and rotate it to the desired location.



##### Straight Shell Impactor: 7004-0100

### Notes

- Avoid catching soft tissue debris onto the frictional shell surface during implantation.

- Shell positioning must be carefully considered when selecting certain inserts as hooded options are not available in all sizes to adjust joint stability. Proper positioning of the Trident II Acetabular Shell may minimize potential impingement and promote stability and articulation between the insert and head. As with any acetabular system, excessive vertical orientation and/or anteversion of the shell should be avoided, as this may lead to premature wear and/or noise of the components' surfaces.

- While the alignment guides offer some assistance in shell placement, it is important to critically evaluate anatomic landmarks before shell implantation. These anatomic landmarks include the anterior and posterior walls of the acetabulum, the sciatic notch, the transacetabular ligament (TAL), the floor and/or acetabular fossa of the acetabulum.

### Caution

The Alignment Guide's utility may be diminished if the pelvis has moved from the original position during intraoperative manipulation. Small changes in pelvic flexion will greatly affect anteversion. The Alignment Guide is only one aid to assist with proper implant positioning. The surgeon must also rely on anatomic landmarks to avoid improper positioning of components.

**Keywords:** ancillary screw fixation, 6.5mm Low Profile Hex Screws, Trident II Non-Captive U-Joint Driver, Drill Bit, screw insertion

## Step 5A

### Optional ancillary screw fixation

If the decision is made to use ancillary screw fixation, then only 6.5mm Low Profile Hex Screws (7030-65XX) may be used. The Cancellous Bone Screws are 6.5mm in diameter and available in a variety of lengths from 15-60mm (Table 3). The acetabular screws are designed to be inserted and removed with the Trident II screw instrumentation (Table 4). Single Use Drill Bits are also offered for bone preparation.

Attach a 3.3 or 4.0mm Drill Bit to the Ball Joint Drill Shaft and connect to an appropriate power bone drill. After determining the site for screw placement, pass the appropriately sized Drill Bit through the Drill Guide of equivalent diameter size and insert the guide flush to the shell screw hole (Figure 12). Use of the guide is required to ensure proper alignment of the hole trajectory to the screw hole and facilitates full seating of the screw head within the shell upon insertion. Drill to the desired depth and insert the Depth Gauge to aid in selection of the appropriate screw size.

To insert a screw using the Trident II Non-Captive U-Joint Driver (marked "Non-Captive") (Figure 13), use the Screw Forceps to hold the screw and guide it into the implant.

If using the Trident II Straight Driver, attach the screw to the driver tip. The Straight Driver tip has a captive design to hold the screw on, however excessive shaking or motion may cause the screw to detach. Screw Forceps may be used to hold the screw and guide into the implant.

Following screw insertion into bone, confirm the screw head is seated flush against the shell to help prevent eventual improper seating of the acetabular insert.

      ‚Ä¢ An optional Trident II U-Joint Driver with a captive tip (7005-0100) is available as an alternative to the Trident II Non-Captive U-Joint Driver. To use this driver, attach the screw to the driver tip. The tip has a captive design to hold the screw on, however excessive shaking or motion may cause the screw to detach. Screw Forceps may be used for this driver.<br><br>
      ‚Ä¢ Trident II Acetabular Shells are not intended to be drilled through.<br><br>
      ‚Ä¢ In dense bone, the use of 4.0mm Drill Bits may facilitate easier insertion of screws without substantial compromise of screw purchase.<br><br>
      ‚Ä¢ For drilling screw holes deeper than 40mm, it is recommended to drill sequentially with a 25mm/ 40mm bit and then follow with a 60mm bit to deepen to desired depth.
   
### Caution

‚Ä¢ Do not use a dull Drill Bit as it may generate excessive stresses in the bone.

‚Ä¢ Do not pass a drill, screw any other instrumentation beyond the inner table of the pelvis.

Malposition of either the shell screw hole orientation or bone hole trajectory, or improper use of the screws may result in injury to the neurovascular structures in the vicinity.

‚Ä¢ Once screws are inserted, confirm screw heads do not protrude into the inside of shell and interfere with proper assembly of liner implant.

‚Ä¢ Do not use a power drill to insert the screw, as excessive torque may result in damage to screw or driver.

‚Ä¢ Operating the Ball Joint Drill Shaft at angles exceeding 45Àö for prolonged periods of time or with excessive force can lead to damage to the flexible joint and Drill Bit.

**Keywords:** Trial Insert Reduction, Trident Eccentric Trials, joint mechanics evaluation, implant trials, intraoperative X-ray

## Step 6

### Trial Insert reduction

A joint mechanics evaluation may be performed with implant trials following femoral preparation and shell implantation. Insert a Trial Insert into the Trident II Shell (Figure 17a).

An optional Trial Insert Hex Containment Screw for securing the trial to the shell is available (Figure 17b). Only use a Straight Driver (7005-0099) or optional Trident II U-Joint (7005-0100) to insert the Hex Containment. Only these two drivers have a captive tip design to hold the Hex Containment Screw on, however excessive shaking or motion may cause the screw to detach.

Do not overtighten as this may lead to liner trial damage.

To facilitate insertion/removal of the Trial Insert, Screw Forceps may be placed into the two holes in the plastic face.

After reducing the femoral and acetabular trials, the patient should be taken through a complete range of motion. Trials matching the final selected implant sizes should be used. Careful assessment of impingement at the extreme range of motion should be performed. A final check of hip mechanics should be completed to include range of motion consistent with the patient's normal daily activities.

At this point, joint laxity should also be assessed, taking into consideration the type of anesthetic used and its effects on soft tissue. Additionally, an intraoperative X-ray may be taken at this point to assess leg length, offset, component size and position.

### Note
Impingement should be carefully assessed and avoided during range of motion. Impingement can result in increased wear in metal-polyethylene systems, as well as instability.

## Appendix A

### Insert implantation

The Trident Polyethylene Insert is designed to lock into the shell by means of a circumferential ring that engages the mating groove within the shell. Rotational stability can be achieved when the anti-rotational barbs of the shell interlock with the insert scallops. Trident Alumina Ceramic Inserts are designed to gain fixation within the shell by means of mating tapers. Rotational stability between the components is achieved when the shell's anti-rotational barbs interlock with the insert scallops.


1. Ensure that the inside of the shell and periphery are clean and free of soft tissue or any other debris which can cause eccentric positioning of the insert and improper seating in the shell.

2. Gently introduce the ceramic or polyethylene insert, making sure that the insert flange scallops are aligned with the slots at the rim of the shell. This orientation will allow the insert to rest on the four indexing barbs and will ensure that the insert is parallel with the shell. Once the insert is seated at the initial position, slowly turn and drop the insert into the final pre-locked position.

3. Select the appropriately sized Plastic Insert Impactor Tip and load onto Insert Positioner/Impactor Handle (Figure 18).

4. Position Insert Positioner/Impactor Handle into the inner diameter of the insert. Take care to align the handle with the axis of the shell. Strike the handle with approximately four firm mallet blows to fully seat the insert (Figure 19).

> Having a clear view of the rim of the acetabulum will allow easier visualization of the shell slots and indexing barbs for proper positioning and seating of the liner.


> Use caution handling ceramic components during assembly because of brittle nature of the ceramic material. All components are pre-sterilized and cannot be sterilized after opening.

## Appendix A (continued)

### Head assembly

Prior to head assembly to the implanted femoral stem, neck length selection may be reevaluated using Stryker's V40 or C-Taper head trial. Place the head trial onto the stem neck taper and reduce the hip to verify that the mechanics have not been altered due to shell seating.

Remove the head trial and dry the implant trunnion with a laparatomy sponge or sterile towel.

Select the appropriate corresponding V40 or C-Taper femoral head size and place it onto the dry trunnion of the femoral stem with a slight twist. Impact the head with moderate impactions in line with the neck using the Stem Head Impactor (1104-1000) (Figure 20). Care should be taken to prevent scratching of the femoral head against the acetabular component rim during final reduction.

With the final selected femoral, head and acetabular implants in place, reduce the components and perform a final joint mechanics evaluation of the patient.

### Optional step

#### Universal Adapter Sleeves

After completing the trialing process, assemble the Universal Adapter Sleeve to the femoral stem manually. The Universal Adapter Sleeve must be fully seated on the stem taper before the head is assembled. Intraoperatively assemble the BIOLOX delta Universal Taper Ceramic Head onto the sleeved femoral stem and set with moderate impactions in line with the neck using the Stem Head Impactor (1104-1000). Care must be taken to avoid excessive impact forces when assembling the BIOLOX delta Ceramic Head to the sleeved femoral component.

### Notes

- When selecting a BIOLOX delta Universal Taper Ceramic Head for implantation, use of a Universal Adapter Sleeve is necessary.

- In no instance should any attempt be made to preassemble the Universal Adapter Sleeve inside the BIOLOX delta Universal Ceramic Head.

## Appendix B

### Modular Dual Mobility

#### MDM Liner implantation

Ensure that the inside of the shell is clean, dry and free of soft tissue or any other debris, which could prevent the liner from properly seating in the shell.

Gently introduce the MDM Liner, making sure that the liner flange scallops are aligned with the slots in the rim of the shell. This orientation will allow the liner to rest on the four indexing barbs and will ensure that the liner is parallel with the shell. Next, slowly turn the liner until it drops into the final pre-locking position. Correct rotational orientation will result in the liner tabs aligned with the slots on the shell rim.

Apply finger pressure around the rim of the liner first to engage the liner within the shell.

Load a 36mm Plastic Insert Impactor Tip onto the Insert Positioner/Impactor Handle. It may be necessary to lightly tap on the rim of the liner with the Plastic Insert Impactor Tip, working around the rim in all four quadrants, to ensure the liner is properly seated and concentric within the shell.

The liner is properly seated when there is no further rocking or movement of the liner within the shell. This step should be done prior to final impaction of the liner.

Position the Postioner/Impactor Handle into the inner diameter of the liner. Take care to align the handle with the axis of the shell. Strike the handle with several mallet blows to fully seat the liner. MDM Liners are designed to lock within the shell by means of mating tapers.

Verify the liner is properly aligned and fully seated into the acetabular shell. Check the taper lock by running a small blunt instrument (or the Liner Removal Tool) around the periphery of the shell/ liner interface. There should not be any space between the rim of the shell and the underside of the rim.

Visually assess the inner articular surface of the MDM Liner to ensure it is not scratched or damaged prior to the trial insert/head reduction.

#### Notes

- As with any modular interface under load, there is a potential for fretting and/or corrosion. Proper alignment and locking of the MDM Liner into the shell may help to minimize this risk.

- Having a clear view of the rim of the acetabulum will allow easier visualization of the shell slots and indexing barbs for proper positioning and seating of the liner.

#### Caution

- Care should be taken to avoid forcing the MDM Liner Trial into place when trialing with the shell. The liner trial should freely assemble with the shell.

- Care should be taken to avoid damage to the highly polished inner surface of the MDM CoCr Liner.

- Care should be taken to ensure that the liner is correctly aligned within the shell. Failure to do so may result in incomplete or incorrect liner engagement.

**Keywords:** Polyethylene Insert Removal, MDM Liner Removal, Ceramic Insert Removal, Trident II Shell Removal, Trident Insert Revision



## Appendix C

### Removal of the insert and shell

#### Polyethylene insert removal
Use a 3.3mm Drill Bit to create an off-center hole in the polyethylene insert. Care must be taken to avoid drilling through an unused screw hole and into the wall of the acetabulum. Use the T-Handle (1101-2100) to thread the Polyethylene Insert Removal Tool (2112-0010) into the insert, and advance the tool to the medial wall of the shell to dislodge the insert (Figures 21 and 22). If the Polyethylene Insert Removal Tool is not available, then a 6.5mm Cancellous Screw may be used.

#### MDM Liner removal
Should it become necessary to remove the MDM Liner from the Trident II Shell, refer to the MDM X3 surgical technique.

#### Ceramic Insert removal
The Trident Alumina Insert Removal Tool is designed to provide the surgeon with two options for extracting the ceramic insert from the Trident shell.

##### Option 1: Flat head
Connect the T-Handle to the L-shaped end of the removal tool. Insert the flat end of the removal tool between the shell and ceramic insert at one of the four notches at the shell rim. While applying continuous force toward the center of the shell, twist the T-Handle (like a screwdriver), to dislodge the ceramic insert (Figure 24). It may be required to repeat this procedure at the other notches in order to successfully disengage the taper.

##### Option 2: L-shaped
Insert the L-shaped end of the removal tool between the shell and ceramic insert at one of the four notches at the shell rim. Apply continuous force toward the center of the shell, and lever the tool in a plane tangent to the shell's outside edge to dislodge the ceramic insert (Figure 24). It may be required to repeat this procedure at the other notches in order to successfully disengage the taper.

The removal tool may be attached to the Insert Positioner/ Impactor Handle to increase leverage and length for larger patients.

#### Trident II Shell removal
Should removal of the metal shell become necessary, a curved osteotome, compatible cup removal system or small burr can be passed around the cup periphery to loosen the fixation interface. The Shell Impactor is then threaded into the dome hole of the cup. Gently impact the impaction pad with a mallet to assist with shell removal.

### Notes

- An alternative shell removal technique is to toggle the shell to loosen it and remove it by hand. Use caution when using shell extraction devices.
- Having a clear view of the rim of the acetabulum will allow easier visualization of the shell slots and indexing barbs for proper positioning and seating of the insert.

### Revising the Trident II Shell with a Trident Insert
Should it become necessary to remove the insert, a new Polyethylene Insert can be inserted into the Trident II Shell.

1. Carefully remove the Trident Insert (refer to instructions above) and inspect the shell locking mechanism for any potential damage. If the locking mechanism is damaged during liner removal, the shell should not be used.

2. The Trident Insert Trials are used to evaluate the shell face position and provide a final check of hip biomechanics. Polyethylene inserts are available in various configurations and sizes, including 0¬∞, 10¬∞ and constrained insert options. The polyethylene inserts provide 12 different insert orientations within the shell to facilitate optimal joint stability.

3. Follow Appendix A: Insert liner.

The Head Disassembly Instrument is used to remove an impacted head (Figures 25 and 26). Inspect the stem neck trunnion to verify that no damage has occurred prior to impacting a replacement head. A replacement head may then be attached to the stem neck taper and secured using the Stem Head Impactor.

### Revision of BIOLOX delta Ceramic Heads assembled with an adapter sleeve

If the BIOLOX delta Ceramic Head needs to be revised for any reason, remove the Ceramic Head with the Head Disassembly Instrument (1118- 6000* or 6059-9-505 depending on femoral head size) and remove the adapter sleeve with the Ceramic Head Sleeve Disassembly Adapter (1118-1005* and 1118-6000*).

### Note

* This Head Disassembly Instrument (1118-6000*) cannot be used with 36, 40, and 44mm heads.

## Step 7

### Head disassembly (continued)

The following table provides a guide for selecting a replacement head. The first two columns describe the stem taper type and original femoral head material used, and the third column lists the available replacement options.

### Notes:
‚Ä¢ Metal heads and BIOLOX delta Ceramic Heads with sleeve only can be used in revision cases only if the stem trunnion appears undamaged and intact upon close inspection. The entire hip stem must be revised if this is not the case.

‚Ä¢ BIOLOX delta Ceramic Heads and metal heads can be used with polyethylene liners.

‚Ä¢ Do not reassemble a BIOLOX delta Ceramic Head and stem. Once a BIOLOX delta Ceramic Head has been assembled to a stem taper, it should never be reassembled to that stem or subsequently assembled to any other stem. In addition, a BIOLOX delta Ceramic Head should only be assembled to an unused stem taper. Once a stem taper has been assembled to any femoral head, it should never be subsequently assembled to any BIOLOX delta Ceramic Head component due to deformation of the stem's taper locking mechanism during initial stem/head assembly.
