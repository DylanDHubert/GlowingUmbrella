Peg locations are the same for symmetric and asymmetric Triathlon patellae except for Triathlon symmetric patella size 27 and size 29. The two smallest Triathlon symmetric patellae, S27 X 8 and S29 X 8, have the pegs closer together compared to the rest of the Triathlon patella size options. In the table below, patella sizes with the same colors have the same peg locations.

**Keywords:** Triathlon Total Knee System, CR Insert, CS Insert, Anterior Height, Anteroposterior dimension

# Slope and size incremental

- There is no slope built into CR, CS, PS and TS inserts.
- Triathlon CS insert has approximately 2mm more height in the anterior lip of the insert compared to Triathlon CR.

AP dimension increases only anteriorly. For sizes 1-7, size incremental is ≤3mm. For sizes 7-8, size incremental is 4mm.

# Difficult primary

# Femoral

- Triathlon TS augments can be used with Triathlon primary PS femur.
- Distal augments are for use with both the medial and lateral portions of the side indicated, e.g., side right is used for medial and lateral compartments on a right femur.
- Posterior augments are universal size-specific, e.g., size 4 posterior augments are for the size 4 femurs.

# Tibial insert

- The PS post height is 24mm. The TS post height is 26mm.

# Tibial baseplate

- Triathlon Universal Baseplate can be used with all Triathlon TS augments and stems.
- Tibial augments are size-specific and come in left medial/right lateral or right medial/left lateral configurations.
